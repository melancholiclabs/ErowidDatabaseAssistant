[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Stipa robusta
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Ambiguous
SCHEDULE	ContainsSchedule I Chemical
CLASSIFICATION	Hallucinogen
federalLawText :: Stipa robusta (Sleepy Grass) is not a specifically controlled species in the United States. Live plants and seeds are bought and sold and are not generally considered illegal. However, LSA, one of the chemicals contained in these plants, is Schedule III in the U.S. Practically, this means that if an extraction is done on LSA-containing Stipa species, the resulting LSA is illegal to possess.	
Large scale (especially commercial) extraction of LSA from Stipa species falls into the realm of "clearly illegal" and would very likely be prosecuted. It is also possible that importation of LSA-containing Stipa species into the United States could result in problems with customs, especially if large volumes are imported.
