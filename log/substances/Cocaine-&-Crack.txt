[Basics]
description :: Cocaine is a naturally derived CNS (central nervous system) stimulant extracted and refined from the Coca plant grown primarily in the Andean region of South America. Cocaine is typically a white-ish powder with a bitter, numbing taste. It is most often insufflated (snorted), though it can also be injected and used orally.  While powder cocaine can be smoked to some effect (despite common belief otherwise), it is a very inefficient method of ingestion. Because of the high temperatures present when smoking, powder cocaine tends to burn rather than vaporizing. For this reason, freebase cocaine, also known as crack in its street form, is created from powder cocaine for smoking. Freebase cocaine vaporizes at smoking temperatures providing more effect with less material, as well as faster onset and a more intense high than powder cocaine. [ Main Cocaine Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	Dose Summary Needed.
price	In the United States in 2011, powder cocaine is sold for around $20-30 for 0.25 gram, $60-100 per gram, and $120-200 for 3.5 grams (1/8 ounce).
law	Cocaine is illegal to possess and sell in the United States (schedule II) and in most other countries. It became a regulated substance in 1914, as one of the first substances to be made illegal in the U.S.
chemistry	The chemical name for cocaine is benzoylmethyl ecgonine (C17H21NO4). It is a bitter, white, odorless, crystalline drug.
pharmacology	Pharmacology Summary Needed.
production	Production Summary Needed.
history	Coca leaf chewing has been practiced for thousands of years. Cocaine was first isolated from the Erythroxylon coca plant around 1850. Medicinal use of Cocaine increased through the late 19th century and recreational use started to become a known problem in the early 20th century. Recreational use was banned in the United States in 1914.
terminology	The Substance:Cocaine: Coke; Snow; Nose Candy; Dust; White Lady; Toot; Llello. 								Freebase Cocaine: Crack; Rock. The Experience:Coked up.
effects :: As with many substances, the effects of cocaine depend greatly on the person and the dose. Possible effects include feelings of well-being, decreased appetite, stimulation, sexual arousal, and increased focus. Negative effects can include increased body temperature and heart rate, agitation and anxiety, paranoia, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, violent behavior, kidney failure, seizure, stroke, and heart attack.
effectsSections :: onset	Onset varies depending on method of ingestion. Snorting cocaine will produce effects within a minute. Smoking freebase cocaine produces effects almost immediately...often before exhaling. Injected cocaine also produces effects within a few seconds.
duration	The effects of snorted cocaine are quite short with the primary high lasting only 20-40 minutes. This is one of the reasons leading to problems with addiction. As the effects wear off, more is often snorted. This pattern of repeated use can quickly move in the direction of addiction. A hit of smoked Crack (freebase cocaine) will typically produce effects lasting 5-15 minutes.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: Street cocaine is quite often impure. The more direct the route of administration, the more dangerous this can be. Injecting impure cocaine can be deadly. Repeated snorting can cause severe damage to the nose. Smoking of freebase cocaine can cause breathing difficulties.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Research shows that cocaine use during pregnancy may increase chances of miscarriage, premature labour, and stillbirth. Cocaine is likely to be passed to a child during breast-feeding, resulting in irritability and lack of appetite in the baby.
addiction	One of the most problematic aspects of cocaine is its addictive qualities. While cocaine is not believed to be physically addicting, it is, without a doubt, psychologically addicting. Those who use cocaine heavily or regularly frequently encounter great difficulty ceasing use.  Many people find themselves drawn to overusing both crack and powder cocaine. Initial tolerance develops rapidly, especially with heavy use, though tolerance appears to level off relatively quickly (users do not generally require more and more material over time, once they have reached heavy use).

description :: Cocaine is both a central nervous system stimulant and a topical anaesthetic. It is found in the leaves of the Erthroxylum coca plant. The traditional method of coca use is to "chew" the leaves (the leaves are actually not chewed so much as sucked, producing a mild stimulation. Outside of South America it is generally used in its more refined and extracted forms: either powder cocaine, or freebase cocaine which produce much stronger effects than "chewing" the leaves. The term "Crack" is alternately used to refer to street quality freebase cocaine, or to refer to the product of a particular manufacturing process which uses sodium bicarbonate rather than a flammable solvent. Powdered cocaine is generally insufflated (snorted) and crack / freebase cocaine is generally smoked. Smoking freebase cocaine causes a strong, short-lived peak of about 3-5 minutes, while snorting cocaine provides a lower high with major effects lasting closer to 15 - 30 minutes.	
PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS:	Varies with dose and the tolerance of the user. Increases alertness, wakefulness, elevates the mood, mild to high degree of euphoria, increases athletic performance, decreases fatigue, clearer thinking, increases concentration, increases energy, increased irritability, insomnia, restlessness. With high doses may exhibit a pattern of psychosis with confused and disorganized behavior, irritability, fear, paranoia, hallucinations, may become extremely antisocial and aggressive.	
PHYSICAL EFFECTS:	Increases heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and sweating. Increases speed of respiration, dilates the pupils, decreased sleep and appetite. Can decrease seizure threshold and is associated with seizures, strokes, and heart attacks in susceptible individuals.	
WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS:	Although cocaine does not cause dangerous physical addiction, discontinuing regular use can lead to a wide varieties of (very) unpleasant withdrawal and craving symptoms, including: intense cravings for more cocaine, hunger, irritability, apathy, depression, paranoia, suicidal ideation, loss of sex drive, insomnia or excessive sleep, dizziness, shaking, and/or feeling cold. Although the withdrawal from heavy cocaine use is not as debilitating as the withdrawal from opiates or benzodiazepines, it is still usually quite unpleasant. Often, individuals simply take more cocaine to reduce these effects, leading to a pattern of habituation, dependence, and addiction.	
HEAVY, REPEATED USE:	As of 2015, a majority of powder cocaine outside of South America contains levamisole. Repeated use of levamisole can compromise the immune system.	

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS:	Agitation, hostility, hallucinations, convulsions, high body tempertature (hyperthermia), stroke, heart attack, and possibly death.	
People with latent congenital heart defects, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems are at higher risk of dangerous reactions and heart failure with the recreational use of cocaine.	
LONG-TERM USE:	Heavy, regular use of cocaine is known to cause restlessness, anxiety, hyperexcitability, paranoia, irritability, insomnia, weight loss, and a variety of other less acute psychological symptoms. Insufflation of any substance can lead to damaging the cartiledge and mucosa in the nose, eventually leading to a hole in the septum (the soft structure separating the nostils). If injected, cocaine use can lead to a wide variety of problems including life-threatening infections, shared needle-related blood diseases, etc.
experienceReports :: [Crack cocaine compared to Insufflated Powder Cocaine] "Crack, I soon discovered had one big difference for me from coke. When I would binge on coke I would always reach a point where it just didn’t do anything for me. After 6, 7, 8 hours of partying, each new line just didn’t get me high and I would really feel like shit and stop. Crack was different. Each hit got me high. Only as the night goes on the high last for less and less time each hit. But each hit holds the promise of a new high. That’s what makes it so addicting." -- Exp 74175[Insufflated Powder Cocaine] "I felt invigorated, yet also very comfortable. It was suprising how physical the sensations actually were. I had a warm, tingly sensation in my limbs." -- Exp 43976[Insufflated Powder Cocaine] "How can I best describe the feeling of a good coke high to someone unfamiliar with it? Like this: it's like living, real-time, in a Hollywood movie. Have you noticed how, in a movie, only the salient and dramatic moments of a character's story are spliced together? You never, for example, have to slog through the onscreen character's having to clip his toenails or pay bills or pop a blackhead, or listen to long interstices of silence in the ramble of a desultory conversation. Thus is reality for the Coked: life is poetry: accelerated, shined, tweaked, pruned of its prosaic, pedestrian footage. Every utterance you or your fellow stonees make seems to be sharp, dramatic, witty, encapsulated-- jjust like movie dialogue. Little transitional moments disappear: you find yourself engaged in group chatter one moment, then looking into their bathroom mirror the next, just like in an elegant film edit. Above all, there is an immanent thrill in your loins that SOMETHING exciting-- one doesn't know quite WHAT-- is going to HAPPEN. ANY second now. (It often never does, but one is not swayed.)" -- Exp 1643[Intravenous (IV)] I put down the needle, and then I closed my eyes and tilted my head backwards, enjoying the rush of intense pleasure I felt throughout my entire body. It felt better than any orgasm I had ever experienced. My tongue became numb, and I could taste cocaine in my mouth, even though there was none there. My heart was beating a million miles an hour. My mind was racing, going from one random thought to another thought. Physically, however, I felt very relaxed. I stood from sitting on the edge of the tub, and walked toward the mirror. I was a little wobbly on my feet, and when I looked at myself in the mirror, I grinned crazily at myself." -- Exp 68053[Insufflated Powder Cocaine] "For the next 6 months or so, I did coke constantly. A bunch of us would drink and do lines many nights, including weeknights. We would sit around and talk and play cards and board games and watch tv and the time seemed to just fly by. I loved all aspects of doing coke, especially the ritual of it all - I loved cutting it all up and moving it around and organizing it into lines with a razor blade. I loved the feelings, both mental and physical. I would look forward every day to the next time I would feel that telltale acidic drip in my throat, the numbing of my teeth, and the absolute bliss. I felt much less socially awkward when I was on this drug: I could talk to anyone about anything." -- Exp 57762[Intravenous (IV)] "I LOVE the feeling of injecting it so much it scares me." -- Exp 37703[Insufflated Powder Cocaine] "My body felt strangely cold and clammy all over, yet my mind and chest felt very warm and almost pulsating with energy. As I filled up a glass of water I noticed very strong and euphoric anticipations of talking to Bob and Rob again, even though it was only a minute since I had seen them last. I can best explain this as the mild emotional-bonding effects of MDMA. [...] I entered the door to my room and was extremely happy to be back with my friends. " -- Exp 21524[Smoked Crack Cocaine] Once I started I was never sated, no matter how much I had consumed, and once the dope was gone I was always certain that someone had more and was holding out on me." -- Exp 37703[Smoked Freebase Cocaine] "Wait, I am not sure that I got enough... Oh! NOW I get it."
