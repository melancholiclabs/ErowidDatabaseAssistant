Fresh Theobroma cacao seeds	https://www.erowid.org/plants/show_image.php?i=cacao/theobroma_cacao_seeds__i2012e0294_disp.jpg	After the fruit is consumed (or discarded), the T. cacao seeds are dried on a screen. Once dry, they can be consumed raw as a mildly stimulating snack. However, many people toast them to make them crunchier before eating them, blending them in milk, or making their own chocoolate confections.
