problemsSections :: contraindications	Chloral hydrate passes into the breast milk and may cause drowsiness in babies of mothers using it. Chloral hydrate in combination with Central nervous system (CNS) depressants (medicine that causes drowsiness) may increase the depressant effects of both. Chloral hydrate in combination with Tricyclic antidepressants may increase the depressant effects of both. Individuals with a history of heart diseases may be at higher risk. Preexisting liver or kidney problems may cause an increase of chloral hydrate levels in the blood, increasing risks.
addiction	Dependence may develop in those disposed towards addiction. Addiction is similar to alcohol dependence and can develop quickly, in a matter of weeks of regular use.
