description :: MDA's effects are very similar to the effects of MDMA. See also MDMA Effects.	
Note: Erowid previously reported the duration of MDA to be "8-12 hours" based on the entry in PIHKAL which appears to be wrong. After checking with a variety of sources, the consistent opinion is that MDA lasts just slightly longer than MDMA, but is otherwise very equivalent in duration. Many users report it has a longer, more stimulated after-effects period but others do not find this. If you have comments about experiences with known pure MDA or know of other verifiable resources, please let us know.	
We do have a couple reports of idiosyncratic reactions where users had effects for 12-18 hours after ingestion, but there are equivalent reports for MDMA. In research published in 2010, Baggott, Siegrist et al., gave twelve subjects MDA (1.4mg/kg, around 100mg (and placebo during a different session) and administered a series of tests to assess effects. For five of the twelve participants, the MDA high lasted a total of about six hours, but in several of the participants, the effects were still quite strong at 6-8 hours. The "MDA Effects Curve" duration graph (data from that study) shows effects still clearly off baseline at 8 hours after dosing. It is unknown why some people would stay high much longer than others, but it could be based on individual metabolism.	
L's Comparison of MDA to MDMA:	The total experience is 8 hours, but the 'trip' is 4-5 hours like X. The after-effects are like being way-laid, definitely washing around in the	after-swell of a full experience of an amphetamine-hallucinogen. We call MDA 'industrial electronic mushrooms' and compare the post-peak to riding the diesel-electric locomotive all the way home. Your feet vibrate for some time after you step off a huge machine like that: tingling and numb. There's no finer intoxicant, but you need careful and considerable support or the body load can turn you into a vegetable for the latter half of the experience and the day after. With X you feel all the emotional and spiritual connectivy possible (much the 'empathogen'), with MDA you see (hallucinate, visually experience) all the emotional and spiritual connectivity possible.	


Gracie & Zarkov's Comparison of MDA to MDMA:	"The differences from MDM(A) are striking: MDA is more hallucinogenic with noticeable closed eye imagery, is a much greater aesthetic enhancer, especially of people and of music; is more euphoric; more "drug-like", a heavier and more obviously body-involved trip. Tactile sensation is more powerful, erotic and noticeable on MDA. Physical effects are more up-front: gastric upset, pupil dilation, water retention, limbic arousal. On the whole, we find MDA a more enjoyable and interesting trip; longer lasting and more sexual/sensual. Our favorite characteristic is that one retains an interesting psychedelic ideation on MDA, rather then the feeling-oriented, but rather idealess thinking of MDM(A).
