[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Ethylphenidate
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
SCHEDULE	Un-Scheduled
federalLawText :: Ethylphenidate is not specifically scheduled in the United States. However, it is likely that it would be considered a controlled substance analogue (of methylphenidate, a Schedule II substance), in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act.
stateLaw :: Utah	Ethylphenidate is a controlled substance in Utah, along with its "analogs, homologs, and synthetic equivalents". See http://le.utah.gov/code/TITLE58/htm/58_37_000402.htm. (thanks J) (last updated Mar 17, 2014)
internationalLaw :: Canad	Ethylphenidate is not listed/Scheduled under Canadian law and Canada has no analog law. (thanks gl, eg) (last updated Oct 13, 2014)
Germany (Deutschland	6-APB, 5-APB, Buphedrone, 3,4-Dimethylmethcathinone, Ethylphenidate, 3-Fluoromethcathinone, Pentedrone, and alpha-PVP became controlled in July, 2013. See http://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/fileadmin/dateien/Downloads/B/Betaeubungsmittelgesetz/27_BtMAEndV.pdf and http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btmg_1981/index.html. (thanks jl) (last updated Jul 21 2013)
Norway	Ethylphenidate is not specifically listed as controlled in Norway. The laws in Norway are complex, and there are two main areas of law that cover psychoactive drugs. There is the "Forskrift om narkotika" (=narcotics regulation), which mostly covers chemical compounds directly, and the "Forskrift om legemiddelklassifisering" (=regulations of medication classification), covering plants and herbs. Although the narcotics regulation covers "Salts, stereo isomers, esters and ethers of substances and groups of substances listed in the narcotics regulation, assuming the substances has or are believed to have psychoactive effects.", ethylphenidate does not appear to be covered by these rules. Ethylphenidate is a clear analog of methylphenidate, but Norway's laws do not make ethylphenidate controlled because it is similar in structure to the medicine methylphenidate.

Sweden	Ethylphenidate is in Appendix 1, illegal for most purposes, as of 2012. http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Forordning-19921554-om-kont_sfs-1992-1554/. (thanks r) (last updated Jun 21 2013)
United Kingdom (U.K., Britain, England, Scotland, Wales	In April, 2015, Ethylphenidate was placed under emergency control as "Temporary Class Drugs", making it illegal to sell or manufacture without licensure. Possession is not yet illegal. See https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/circular-0152015-temporary-control-of-5-methylphenidate-based-nps/circular-0152015-temporary-control-of-5-methylphenidate-based-nps.

[Dose]
doseTable :: Ethylphenidate Dosages
Insufflated
( tentative )
Threshold	2 - 5 mg
Light	5 - 20 mg
Common	20 - 50 mg
Strong	40 - 200 mg
Heavy	100+ mg
doseText :: Ethylphenidate (EPH) is a stimulant, with similar effects to methylphenidate (Ritalin). At lower doses it has productivity-enhancing and attention-improving effects. At higher doses its euphoric effects increase. It can be taken nasally, orally, or rectally.  Dosages depend on the effects desired by the user. When taken for increased productivity, doses range from 5-75 mg (oral or insufflated). Dosages for euphoric recreational experiences are perhaps twice as high. For example, 40 mg ethylphenidate taken orally might be considered "strong" for someone using it in a professional work environment, while the same person might find 40 mg to be "light" if taken recreationally at a party and 80 mg or more required for a "strong" dose.
notes :: As of early 2016, ethylphenidate quality/purity appears to vary widely, complicating accurate dosage information. There are large variations reported between doses and corresponding effects. In online forums, people have commented extensively on what they perceive to be quality variations from batch to batch. This may be caused or exacerbated by EPH being synthesized as a racemic mixture; the proportional amounts of l-isomer and d-isomer might vary from batch to batch.	
People report increasing side effects and nasal problems with higher and/or more frequent doses.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
