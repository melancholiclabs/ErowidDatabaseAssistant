[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Argyreia nervosa
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
SCHEDULE	Un-Scheduled
federalLawText :: Hawaiian Baby Woodrose is not a controlled plant in the United States. Both the live plants and the seeds are commonly sold by botanical supply companies. However, it is important to know that one of the chemicals contained in the seeds, LSA, is Schedule III in the U.S. Practically, this means that if an extraction is done on Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, the resulting LSA is illegal to possess. We are unaware of any cases in which an individual has been prosecuted simply for growing a plant or for doing a home extraction of a plant, although it seems possible that a few such cases exist. Large scale (especially commercial) extraction of LSA from H.B. Woodrose seeds begins to fall into the realm of "clearly illegal" and would certainly be difficult to defend.
stateLaw :: null

Consumption of LSA containing materials such as hawaiian baby woodrose seeds is prohibited under state legislation in most Australian states. (thanks DM)
