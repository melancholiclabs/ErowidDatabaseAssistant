description :: Black Widow spiders are a notorious, mildly poisonous spider, shiny black with a characteristic hour-glass shaped red mark on the underside of their abdomen. Black Widow webs are extremely strong and springy. Despite being known for their poison, the danger is commonly overstated and often no symptoms beyond a red-ring occur after a bite, although severe cramping is more common in young children and the elderly.
