[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Carisoprodol
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Controlled
SCHEDULE	Schedule IV
federalLawText :: Carisoprodol (Soma) was added to Schedule IV in December 2011 (See Federal Register Vol 76 No 238). This means it is illegal to sell without a license and illegal to possess without a valid license or prescription.	
On November 17, 2009, the DEA entered a proposed rule to move carisoprodol to Schedule IV (Federal Register Volume 74, Number 220). It is extremely likely that this rule will become final and carisoprodol will become Schedule IV in the United States. See DEA Diversion.Gov. The DEA has been considering controlling carisoprodol for more than a decade and has listed it as a "Drug of Concern" since August 2006.
