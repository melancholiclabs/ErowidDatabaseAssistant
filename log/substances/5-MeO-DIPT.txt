[Basics]
description :: 5-MeO-DiPT is a pschoactive tryptamine, developed by Alexander Shulgin around 1980, now often known by its recently coined name "foxy". It was widely available on the research chemical market for several years prior to its scheduling in 2003. Reactions to 5-MeO-DIPT vary dramatically from those who find it compelling, sexy, exhilerating, interesting, & joyful to those who find it nauseating, irritating, diarrhea-inducing, and generally un-fun. It is available primarily in powder form--though it is also found in liquid and pressed tablets--and is almost always taken orally, though sometimes snorted. [ Main 5-MeO-DiPT Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	A standard oral dose of 5-MeO-DiPT is between 5-30 mg.
price	Rare but sometimes sold at events for 5-20 USD per dose. Prior to being placed in Schedule I, 5-MeO-DIPT was available from exotic chemical suppliers for 225-300 USD per gram. Around the same from underground sources. (August 2000)
law	5-MeO-DiPT was placed into Schedule I through the emergency scheduling procedure on April 4, 2003. This makes it illegal to buy, sell, or possess without a DEA license. Germany is the only other country we are aware of where 5-MeO-DiPT is specifically listed as illegal.
chemistry	N,N-diisopropyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine (5-MeO-DiPT) is a synthetic chemical tryptamine and thus is structurally related to other tryptamines (natural and synthetic), such as 5-MeO-DMT, N,N-DMT, psiloc(yb)in and serotonin.
pharmacology	Pharmacology Summary Needed.
production	Production Summary Needed.
history	The first publication of the synthesis and pharmacology of this compound was in 1980 by Alexander Shulgin in Communications in Psychopharmacology. It remained an extremely obscure chemical until the late 1990s when it started being produced commercially as a research chemical.
terminology	The Substance:5-MeO-DiPT; Foxy Methoxy; Foxy. The Experience:Tripping.
effects :: 5-MeO-DiPT is often characterized by a strong feeling in the body, sometimes described as buzzing or energy, which some users enjoy and others hate. The effects sought by users include moderate mood lift, euphoria, a sense of well-being, intensification of tactile sensations, visual effects, physcial and mental stimulation, occasional auditory distortions/shifts, and for some users, a significant erotic component. Visual effects may include open and closed eye patterning, movement trails, and brightening or shifting of colors. We have received no reports of completely engrossing visions or hallucinations, or of powerful entheogenic voyages with 5-MeO-DiPT.
effectsSections :: onset	Depending on how much and how recently the user has eaten, oral 5-MeO-DiPT takes between 20-60 minutes to take effect. With smoked or inhaled vapors, effects begin within a few minutes.
duration	Due to the small number of reports and a wide variation in reported durations for this chemical, it is difficult to give reliable estimates of length of action. Some users have reported effects completely abating within 3-5 hours, with a short 1-2 hour peak, while others have reported strong residual stimulation and inability to sleep until 10-14 hours.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: Many users report disliking 5-MeO-DiPT. The most common reported reasons are : nausea, diarrhea & frequent bowel movements, unsettling / anxious stimulation, muscle tension, long tail duration and restless sleep the night after use. In the few accidental overdose reports we've received involving between 30 and 100 mg, the subjects have reported merely stronger effects and increased time on the toilet.
problemsSections :: contraindications	5-MeO-DiPT and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. It is likely that MAOIs could increase the effects of 5MeO-DIPT unpredictably. Taking this chemical while on prescription MAOIs is strongly discouraged. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 5-MeO-DiPT as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
addiction	Not enough data exists to make reliable statements about the addiction potential of 5-MeO-DiPT, however, tryptamines of this class are not known for their addictiveness or tendency for compulsive use. As with most substances, some people may use it more frequently than they or their friends are comfortable with, but we have received no reports of this. As with many psychedelics, there is a short period of tolerance after use. Using 5-MeO-DiPT two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.
long	Long Term Health Problems Summary Needed.
death	Risk of Death Summary Needed.

description :: 5-MeO-DIPT can be quite stimulating and is known for causing sweating. It gained a reputation for being a sex-drug after an early report described a sensual experience and a lurid article described it in PlayBoy. It is also well known for causing diarrhea and gas, although not in all users.	
Though the peak effects are not exceedingly long, the lingering stimulation that can last for up to 12 hours (or more) after the peak has given it a reputation for being quite long. The after effects often include tense muscles and can sometimes include feelings of anxiety or inability to relax.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
