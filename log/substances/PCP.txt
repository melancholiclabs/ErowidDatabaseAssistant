[Basics]
description :: Phencyclidine (PCP) is a synthetic chemical in the dissociative anaesthetic class. It is perhaps best known by the media hype it received in the late 1970's portraying it as a extremely dangerous chemical causing madness, psychotic reactions, and super-human strength. It is found in a variety of forms including crystals/powder, tablets, and liquid. Recently it seems to be available on the underground market most commonly as cannabis joints, regular cigarettes or cannabis leaf dipped in liquid PCP....and usually marketed as something else, seldom as 'PCP'. [ Main PCP Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	PCP is used in very small quantities with 5-10 mg considered an average dose.

history	PCP was first synthesized in 1926 and began being investigated as a human anaesthetic in the mid 1950's by Parke Davis. It was marketed as a human anesthetic for two years under the name 'Sernyl' before being withdrawn from the market due to hallucinations experienced by patients under it's influence. Recreational use rose in the late 60's leading to its placement in Schedule III in the early 70's. After its recreational use continued to rise during the early 70's, PCP was moved to Schedule II in 1978.

description :: Many users report feelings of dissociation, perceptual alterations and loss of coordination after using the drug. Intense hallucinations and delusions as well as a loss of physical control and coordination are also commonly experienced. PCP has been known to induce seizures, coma and even death, especially at high doses, and there is some evidence to indicate that, whilst not physically addictive, it can lead to psychological dependency and drug-seeking behaviour.	
Long-term use has been known to lead to schizophrenia-like psychotic episodes, severe lasting memory loss, disorganised thinking, depression, weight loss, liver abnormalities and rhabomyolysis (skeletal muscle breakdown).
