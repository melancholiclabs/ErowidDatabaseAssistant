[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Psychotria viridis
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Ambiguous
SCHEDULE	ContainsSchedule I Chemical
CLASSIFICATION	Hallucinogen
federalLawText :: Psychotria viridis (Chacruna) is not a specifically controlled species in the United States. Live plants and seeds are bought and sold and are not generally considered illegal. However, DMT, one of the chemicals contained in these plants, is Schedule I in the U.S. Practically, this means that if an extraction is done on DMT containing Psychotria species, the resulting DMT is illegal to possess.	
Large scale (especially commercial) extraction of DMT from Psychotria species falls into the realm of "clearly illegal" and would very likely be prosecuted. It is also possible that importation of DMT containing Psychotria species into the United States could result in problems with customs, especially if large volumes are imported.
stateLaw :: null
internationalLaw :: France	As of May 3, 2005, France added Banisteriopsis caapi, Peganum harmala, Psychotria viridis, Diplopterys cabrerana, Mimosa hostilis, Banisteriopsis rusbyana, harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine (THH), haroml, and harmalol to the list of controlled substances. See France Control Ayahuasca Plants and Chemicals. Earlier, in Jan 2005, a Paris court of appeals determined that Ayahuasca is not considered a preparation of DMT and is therefore not a controlled substance.
Germany	We are told it is legal to possess DMT-containing plants such as Psychotria viridis in Germany, but that intent to process it into a psychoactive preparation is illegal. In August 2008 we received a report that P. viridis is sold by internet vendors based inside of Germany. It does not appear to be listed in the BtMG. (unconfirmed) (thanks BT, R)
