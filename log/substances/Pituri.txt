description :: Duboisia hopwoodii is an Australian shrub that contains nicotine, nornicotine, and sometimes hyoscyamine in its leaves. The plant's roots contain all of these alkaloids, plus scopolamine. A preparation of the leaves and stems called pituri appears to have had a long history of use in traditional Aboriginal society.
