description :: Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existance of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to analgesia, narcotics may produce drowsiness, changes in mood and mental clouding.

[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Hydrocodone
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Scheduled
SCHEDULE	Schedule II
CLASSIFICATION	Opiate
federalLawText :: Hydrocodone and any products which contain it are Schedule II in the United States. This means they are illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription.	
Prior to October 6, 2014, products containing less than 15 mg hydrocodone per dosage unit were Schedule III in the United States. Almost all prescription hydrocodone was prescribed in Schedule III dose units (e.g. Vicodin). In 2013, an FDA advisory panel recommending moving these Schedule III preparations into Schedule II at the DEA's request. Further, a group of US congresspeople pressured the FDA to follow that recommendation, and the change in schedule took effect the following year. See the DEA ruling, the FDA commentary, and .	
Schedule II drug prescriptions may only be refilled with a written prescription.
stateLaw :: 
internationalLaw :: Canada	Although there are many rumors stating that products containing hydrocodone may be purchased over-the-counter in Canada, it appears that Hydrocodone is a Schedule I drug in Canada, requiring a prescription.
China (Macau)	We have heard that products containing hydrocodone (such as Vicodin) can be purchased over-the-counter in Macau.
Colombia	One visitor reported that tramadal, codeine with acetaminophen, hydrocodone with ibuprofen (5/200), and dihydrocodeine by itself can be purchased in Colombia over the counter in any drug store. (unconfirmed) (thanks p) (last updated Jun 12 2013)
Germany	Hydrocodone is BTM Anlage 3 in Germany making it illegal to possess without a BTM prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks PM)
Italy	Although one contributor told us hydrocodone is available over-the-counter, this may be incorrect. We have also been told by more than one submitter that it is available only behind the counter, where a pharmacist can choose whether or not to dispense it if there is no prescription. (unconfirmed) (thanks N, J)
Mexico	Prescription only. Although there are rumors that products containing hydrocodone may be purchased over-the-counter in Mexico, we have been unable to verify these rumors, instead finding that hydrocodone is either available only by prescription or perhaps not available at all, even with a prescription. Lortab, Vicodin, etc are reportedly widely available on the black market (last updated Jan 2004).
Netherlands	Hydrocodone is Schedule I and thus prescription-only in the Netherlands. This makes it illegal to possess without a prescription or license. See http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0014405/geldigheidsdatum_13-05-2013 (thanks r) (last updated May 13, 2013)
