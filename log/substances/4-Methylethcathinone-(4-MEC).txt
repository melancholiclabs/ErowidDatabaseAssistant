[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
4-Methylethcathinone
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Scheduled
SCHEDULE	Schedule I
federalLawText :: 4-Methylethcathinone was emergency scheduled on March 7, 2014. See http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2014/fr0307_2.htm. Prior to this, 4-Methylethcathinone was unscheduled in the United States. There was at least one federal indictment (Apr 2012) for the importation of 1 kg of 4-MEC on the basis of 4-MEC being a federal Analogue of methcathinone.	
There was one case of a business person being charged with selling the similar 4-methylmethcathinone/4-MMC (as 'bath salts') also on the basis of it being an Analogue of methcathinone. (See the WSAZ news story). The 4-MMC case ended with the defendant pleading guilty to a lesser charge not related to the Analogue Act: introducing a misbranded drug into interstate commerce (a charge under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, not the Controlled Substances Act).

[Dose]
doseTable :: 4-Methylethcathinone Dosages
Oral
Threshold	15 - 50 mg
Light	50 - 100 mg
Common	100 - 200 mg
Strong	150 - 300+ mg
doseText :: 4-Methylethcathinone is a stimulant with empathogenic qualities. As of 2011, it is most often found as a powder (either represented as 4-methylethcathinone or included in powder products that don't specify their active chemicals), though some tablets have been pressed that include 4-methylethcathinone.
notes :: Some reports of 4-methylethcathinone use involve redosing ("boosting" / "bumping") multiple times. Users sometimes mix oral and insufflated, taking some 4-methylethcathinone orally, then insufflating some, then taking more orally. Because of the common desire to recapture the pleasurable initial high, redoses are sometimes higher than the initial dose or are spaced closely together in time. Many users report having difficulty not redosing after using a strong dose if more 4-methylethcathinone is available when they are starting to come down. Experience reports in which users find themselves unexpectedly consuming a gram or more of 4-methylethcathinone are common.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
