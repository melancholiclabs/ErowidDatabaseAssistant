internationalLaw :: Australia	As of March 2009, melatonin is not currently available without prescription in Australia. There are products sold over the counter without prescription that are labeled melatonin, but the fine print makes clear that they are either homeopathic (no actual melatonin content) or 'herbal'. Melatonin can be obtained by getting a prescription and then buying it from a chemist. The Therapeutic Goods Administration refuses to provide specific information about whether melatonin will become a non-prescription drug, despite pressures to do so by the public.
