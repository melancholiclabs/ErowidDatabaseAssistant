[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Mimosa tenuiflora (=hostilis)
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Ambiguous
SCHEDULE	ContainsSchedule I Chemical
CLASSIFICATION	Hallucinogen
federalLawText :: Mimosa hostilis (and other Mimosa species) are not specifically controlled species in the United States. However, DMT, one of the chemicals contained in these plants, is Schedule I in the U.S. Practically, this means that if an extraction is done on DMT-containing Mimosa species, the resulting DMT is illegal to possess.	
Live plants and seeds were bought and sold regularly prior to September 2012 when the DEA began cracking down on vendors selling Mimosa species. Reportedly, they first began seizing packages at customs and conducting tests to identify whether they contained controlled substances. Then at least one vendor was raided and Mimosa was seized, although no charges were filed. Because of this, most vendors have now stopped selling Mimosa root bark.	
Large scale (especially commercial) extraction of DMT from Mimosa species falls into the realm of "clearly illegal" and would very likely be prosecuted. It is also possible that importation of DMT containing Mimosa species into the United States could result in problems with customs, especially if large volumes are imported.	
Although not a legal issue, EBay changed its policy as of May 15, 2011 banning the sale of Mimosa hostilis root bark through their site.
stateLaw :: Louisiana	Effective Aug 8, 2005 (signed into law Jun 28, 2005) Louisiana Act No 159 makes 40 plants illegal, including A. peregrina and A. colubrina, when intended for human consumption. The law specifically excludes the "possession, planting, cultivation, growing, or harvesting" of these plants if used "strictly for aesthetic, landscaping, or decorative purposes." (Text of HLS_05RS-52 and Update June 2005)
Tennessee 	Tennessee did not pass the proposed bill that would have banned dozens of plants as "hallucinogenic" when intended for human consumption. Instead, they banned only Salvia divinorum. See Comments on New State Laws Controlling the Consumption of Hallucinogenic Plants.
internationalLaw :: France	As of May 3, 2005, France added Banisteriopsis caapi, Peganum harmala, Psychotria viridis, Diplopterys cabrerana, Mimosa hostilis, Banisteriopsis rusbyana, harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine (THH), haroml, and harmalol to the list of controlled substances. Text of new law additions.
