positiveEffects :: mental and physical stimulation	euphoria, mood lift	feelings of empathy, openness	increase in sociability, desire to talk with others	pleasurable rushing	increased concentration	increased sense of motivation
neutralEffects :: general change in consciousness (as with most psychoactives)	decreased appetite	pupil dilation	unusual body sensations (facial flushing, chills, goosebumps, body energy)	change in body temperature regulation	sweating	increase in heart rate and blood pressure	nystagmus	tremor
negativeEffects :: desire to redose, craving to recapture initial euphoric rush	uncomfortable changes in body temperature (sweating/chills)	heart palpitations	significant increase in heart rate and blood pressure	impaired short term memory	tightened jaw muscles, grinding teeth (trismus and bruxia)	muscle twitching, stiffness, tension, pain	nystagmus	dizziness, light headedness, vertigo	headache	nausea	numbness/tingling in extremities	when insufflated: pain and swelling in nose and throat, sinusitis, nasal bleeding
description :: General Effects Notes	The effects of 4-fluoromethcathinone are often compared to those of 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone), but with significantly less euphoria or feelings of empathy reported. Some users have noted that it feels "toxic", with lingering side effects such as headache, muscle tension and nausea.	
Confusingly, both 4-FMC and, less frequently, its positional isomer 3-FMC have been referred to as "Flephedrone"; they seem to have similar effects.	
Routes of Administration	As with other psychoactives, oral 4-fluoromethcathinone ingestion takes slightly longer to cause effects and lasts longer. Insufflation (snorting) is more associated with compulsive / addictive use patterns.	
Addiction and Compulsive Use	As with 4-methylmethcathinone, compulsive use patterns that are similar to or stronger than those of other recreational euphoric stimulants have been reported. It is unlikely to be physically addictive, meaning that withdrawal symptoms are minimal and likely not life threatening, but psychological addiction seems likely to be a problem in some users with this substance.
experienceReports :: "[unspecified dose and ROA] While 4-fluoromethcathinone is reasonably useful as a stimulant at various dosages, there are well-studied pharmaceuticals that perform much better. 4-FMC always left me with a sort of "'so what?' feeling and no urge whatsoever to take my experiments further." -- "Study of Four Cathinones", Erowid Extracts Jun 2012;(22)10."[30-50 mg, insufflated / 100-200 mg, oral] 4-FMC turned out to be a valuable tool for increasing energy, motivation, and, to some degree, concentration. [...] For general stimulation, insufflated doses of 30�50 mg and oral doses of 100�200 mg seemed to work best." -- "Study of Four Cathinones", Erowid Extracts Jun 2012;(22)11."[150 mg, rectal] Still working on my music collection. It seems a bit like amphetamine in that it encourages mindless repetitive activity. In small doses it could be used as a study aid, perhaps. It is much less more a plain stimulant than mephedrone, methylone, bk-MBDB, less empathic. It is has a low quotient (but not zero) of entactogenic qualities. I feel no uncomfortably elevated heart rate or other signs of physical discomfort so I decide the dose may be too low." -- Exp 86047"[repeated, oral, total ~400 mg] [...] pain and feelings of numbness in all extremities, intense tingling sensations and extreme sensitivity to touch, where even slight contact causes intense pain. Dizzyness, even feeling faintish periodically. Hand & feet freezing cold. Intermittent attacks of nausia. Unusually intense bodily (muscular) stiffness. Headache." -- Exp 84061

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
