[Basics]
description :: Dextromethorphan is a semisynthetic opiate derivative which is legally available over-the-counter in the United States. It is most commonly found in cough suppressants, especially those with "DM" or "Tuss" in their names. It is almost always used orally, although pure DXM powder is occasionally snorted. The effects of DXM generally fall into the category of dissociatives, along with ketamine, PCP, and nitrous. [ Main DXM Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	As with many psychoactive substances, dosages of DXM vary greatly, depending on the individual and the desired level of effects. Recreational doses range from 100 mg to 1200 mg or more.
price	Price Summary Needed.
law	DXM is legal to buy, sell, or possess in the United States although it is increasingly common for stores to require that buyers be over 18 years old. If sold for human consumption, it is regulated by the FDA.
chemistry	Dextromethorphan hydrobromide (C18H25NO) is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine, a chemical found in the opium produced by opium poppies.
pharmacology	DXM is partially converted by first-pass metabolism into the active compound dextrorphan, which exerts cough-suppressing and dissociative effects through non-competitive antagonism of NMDA receptors. It is non-analgesic and does not cause sedation or respiratory depression. It is readily absorbed and has a half life is around four hours.
production	Production Summary Needed.
history	DXM was approved for use as a cough suppressant in 1958 and soon became widely available in pill form as a non-narcotic alternative to opiate-based cough suppressants. Cough syrups replaced the pill form in the late 1970s to discourage recreational use.
terminology	The Substance:DXM; Dextromethorphan; Robo; Tussin. The Experience:Robo-tripping; Tussing; Dexing.
effects :: The DXM experience varies by dose. Different recreational dose ranges are sometimes described in terms of plateaus of effects. Low doses produce a mild stimulant effect. Moderate doses generally produce intoxicating effects that are sometimes compared to alcohol or cannabis use. High doses are dissociative in the sense of causing a feeling of separation from one's body, and are sometimes compared to the effects of other dissociatives such as PCP or ketamine.
effectsSections :: onset	DXM takes 20 minutes to 1 hour to take effect, with higher doses generally taking longer. Peak effects of recreational doses begin 1 1/2 to 3 hours after onset.
duration	Effects of low doses generally last 4-6 hours, with large doses lasting 6 hours or more.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: DXM causes physical and psychological effects that may be frightening or unpleasant. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are relatively common. Psychological effects can include profound disorientation, depression, a feeling of personal disintegration, or a feeling of "unreality" and disconnection that may persist for days. Chronic use may cause depression, psychological dependency, and possibly brain damage. Large doses may be associated with psychotic breaks.  In addition to the risks of DXM itself, many DXM-containing products contain other active ingredients that can be dangerous. Common additives include acetaminophen (Tylenol), which can cause fatal liver-damage in large doses. Products containing Chlorpheniramine Maleate such as Coricidin Cough and Cold should especially be avoided. See DXM Health for more information.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Do not take while pregnant. Dissociatives can seriously affect fetal brain development. Many DXM-containing products (such as Coricidin Cough and Cold) also contain other active ingredients which can be dangerous or fatal in high doses. See Guide to DXM in Nonpresescription Drugs for more information. Avoid using DXM in combination with alcohol. Do not take DXM if you have recently taken an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). DXM and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not take DXM if you have recently taken an SSRI such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), or sertraline (Zoloft). DXM use in combination with other OTC cold remedies can increase risk of adverse reaction.
addiction	Dextromethorphan is believed to be physically non-addictive, but some heavy users report an uncommon psychological addiction. Regular use produces tolerance.
long	There has been concern that DXM, like some other dissociatives, causes vacuoles (small holes) in the brain - a syndrome called Olney's Lesions. However, there is some evidence that these concerns are unfounded.
death	Risk of Death Summary Needed.

[Effects]
duration :: null
positiveEffects :: euphoria, mood lift	increased giggling and laughing	dissociation of mind from body (positive when sought)	creative dream-like experiences	increased tactile sensation	some users report empathic feelings, forgiveness, warm feelings towards others	Some users report reduced depression for days or weeks following a single use.
neutralEffects :: pupil dilation	visual stop motion effect (flanging or strobing)	visual and aural (auditory) hallucinations	decreased sexual functioning (difficulty achieving orgasm)	confusion, disorientation	skin sensitivity, alters tactile (touch) and skin sensations	robotic, zombie-like walking, "robo-walk"	discoordination, reduced agility	Loss of appetite	Involuntary flexing of muscles	Feelings of merging with adjacent objects like a couch or bed (with higher doses)
negativeEffects :: upset stomach, vomiting	dizzyness	body itching	rash, red blotchy skin	diarrhea	fever	tachycardia (racing, pounding heart)	difficulty urinating and urinary retention	some users report feeling disconnected, isolated from others	some users report hangover/depression on the following 1-2 days.	Some users report lasting depression and irritability for weeks following heavy use.
description :: Effects of DXM at low doses can be similar to alcohol, producing carefree clumsiness with a touch of psychedelic and speedy effect. For some, intense and rhythmic music induces a state of euphoria and dancing becomes fun. On a higher dose, imagination can become vividly experienced (not always pleasant), feelings of dissociation from the body can occur and on very high doses profound alterations in consciousness may occur.	
Contraindications	
Avoid using DXM in combination with alcohol.	READ THE LABEL - avoid using cold remedies which contain tylenol, CPM or other medications in combination with DXM. Make sure the product contains only DXM as the active ingredient.	DXM use in combination with other OTC cold remedies can increase risk of adverse reaction.

doseText :: Warnings Coricidin Cough and Cold (CCC or Triple-C) Warning: One of the most common products used as a source of DXM is CCC. This product also contains CPM, which can be dangerous at high doses. Most of the hospitalizations and health problems we hear about resulted from the use of Coricidin Cough and Cold.  Acetaminophen Warning: DXM products containing acetaminophen should not be used recreationally. High doses of acetaminophen can be fatal.  DXM products containing other medicines can be harmful if taken in doses above the recommended limits. Dangerous interactions can occur.      Notes #  DXM by itself is fairly safe at doses recommended for medical use (10-50 mg) and becomes increasingly dangerous with dose increases, although there are only a few documented deaths associated with DXM taken with no other substances. Long-term health risks of high-dose DXM use are not well documented or quantified. A handful of fatalities have been reported from DXM-alone (more are reported from DXM combined with other drugs), but the dosages taken for these fatal overdoses are uncertain.  Two overdose deaths were reported by Rammer, et al., but the dosages were uncertain. Chronic, daily use of DXM dosages of over 500 mg have been reported to Erowid by several individuals, and in a medical study participants were given over 900 mg per day without serious adverse reaction (!?). Walker, Hunt, 1989  As with any powerful psychoactive substance, high doses are more likely to induce difficult experiences, negative side effects, allergic responses, etc. Many people experience severe itching at doses over 100 mg, which can precipitate anxiety attacks.  See also: IPCS InChem's DXM References       Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. Know your Body - Know your Mind - Know your Substance - Know your Source.   Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources and should not be construed as recommendations. Individuals can respond differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.
