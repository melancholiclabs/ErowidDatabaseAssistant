[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Tobacco
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Over-The-CounterAge Restricted
SCHEDULE	Un-Scheduled
federalLawText :: Tobacco and tobacco products are unscheduled in the United States and are legal for adults to both sell and possess. It is against FDA regulations to sell the following products to those under the age of 18:	

Cigarettes	Cigarette tobacco	Smokeless tobacco (Smokeless tobacco includes loose leaf chewing tobacco, plug chewing tobacco, twist chewing tobacco, moist snuff, and dry snuff.)	

It is not federally illegal for those under 18 years old to purchase or possess tobacco...only for stores to sell to them. Some individual states have enacted legislation making possession by minors against the law.	
See the FDA's New Federal Tobacco Regulations regarding children and tobacco.	
After attempting to add frightening labeling to tobacco products, including intentionally horrifying photos of people with diseases, the FDA was sued by tobacco corporations and the proposed rule was stricken. See http://mohajerian.com/eresources/fda-graphic-cigarette-warning-labels.htm.
stateLaw :: California	On July 29, 2008 the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance that will prohibit pharmacies from selling tobacco products, effective October 1, 2008. (see SF Chronicle article)
Louisiana	Effective Jan 1 2007, the Louisiana SmokeFree Air Act took effect, prohibiting smoking in public buildings, schools, and restaurants. The law makes an exception for private residences and vehicles, bars, tobacco shops, and race tracks. The penalty for first-time offenders is a $25 citation, followed by a $50 citation for second-time offenses and $100 citations for subsequent offenses. (see text of law, KATC News coverage, thanks GR).
Maryland	Maryland bans the sale of cigarettes containing cloves: ""It is illegal to sell, give, or otherwise distribute clove cigarettes to ANY person, even if eighteen years old or older [Maryland Code, Criminal Law, 10-106]." See http://www.fha.state.md.us/ohpetup/tobacco/selling.cfm. (thanks C) (last updated Jun 2007)
internationalLaw :: Australia	Minimum Age: 18 to purchase, regulated by federal government. Large fines for any business and/or individual who sells tobacco to a minor. Still many vendors don't ID check and fines may be increased. Nicotine patches and gum are sold at pharmacies at the discretion of the pharmacist. New laws in several states ban smoking indoors in public places (Tasmania, Western Australia, Queensland, ACT) with bans coming in other states in 2007.
Belgium	Minimum Age: Tobacco products cannot be sold to persons under 16. (thanks FH)
Bhutan	Bhutan may be the first country in the world to have banned all tobacco products for its citizens. The ban reportedly does not apply to "foreign tourists", diplomats, and those working for NGOs". See http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4012639.stm Dec 2004. All tobacco products have been banned in the Himalayan nation of Bhutan. Offenders face a $210 dollar fine and shop owners will lose their business license. Foreigners and diplomats are exempt, but will be charged with smuggling if they transfer tobacco to locals. The government has imposed a 100% tax on all tobacco products brought into the country for personal consumption by Bhutanese. (thanks RB) (last updated Jun 2007)
Brazil	Tobacco is legal for persons over the age of 18 in Brazil, though the age limit is reportedly widely ignored. (see WHO report (thanks P)
Canada	Minimum Age: It is prohibited by federal law to provide tobacco products to persons under 18 years of age. Further restrictions may apply in individual provinces. For example, in Alberta, people under age 18 who are caught smoking or in possession of tobacco products can not only have their cigarettes seized by police, but also can be fined up to $100. Quebec, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba have a minimum age of 18 for purchase, the rest are 19. (thanks B) See CBCNews Timeline of Canadian Tobacco Laws.
China	According to BD: Sales/Distribution of Cigarettes to minors of school age is prohibited. [China's Law to Prevent Crimes by Minors, Item 15] and Smoking by elementary and secondary school students is prohibited. [Law of Jun 29 1991 on the exclusive sale of tobacco of the People's Republic of China]
According to BD: Sales/Distribution of Cigarettes to minors of school age is prohibited. [China's Law to Prevent Crimes by Minors, Item 15] and Smoking by elementary and secondary school students is prohibited. [Law of Jun 29 1991 on the exclusive sale of tobacco of the People's Republic of China]	However, these laws are universally ignored. In fact all citizens I interviewed, including a police officer were very fuzy or completely ignorant about the particular rules concerning tobacco.
Croatia	Minimum Age: 18 to purchase, law not widely known. (J)
Czech Republic	Minimum Age: 18 to purchase, possess, or sell tobacco products. (unconfirmed) (thanks hf) (last updated Oct 13 2011)
Denmark	Minimum Age: Illegal to sell tobacco to anyone under 16, law widely ignored. (thanks J)
Finland	Minimum Age: Illegal to sell tobacco to anyone under 18, strickly enforced. Under 30 required to show ID. Smoking inside most buildings prohibited, except for designated smoking-allowed rooms. P writes: "In Filand, smoking at a club is allowed if it has a designated, well-ventilated "tobacco room", where no drinks are allowed. At some of the biggest clubs the rules are not always followed and people tend to drink in the smoking rooms, but there are no chairs and the rooms are generally small. There are many bars and night clubs where there is no smoking room. Smoking is mostly done outside, even when it's -20c with t-shirts. But basically smoking is allowed inside in designated specially built places." (thanks P) (last updated Apr 2, 2013)
Germany	Minimum Age: 18 to purchase, raised from age 16 on Sept 1, 2007. Although the German minimum age law was long-ignored, cigarette vending machines now use bank cards to verify age. Some vending machines still allow those age 16 to buy cigarettes, but the German Government has given until the beginning of 2009 for all to be changed to the new date. (See this World Tobacco report for more information.) (thanks C, DG)
India	Bidis are widely smoked. In 2008, India passed a national law banning smoking in most public and work places. See Washington Post for discussion. (last updated Oct 2008)
Iran	Legal for persons over the age of 18, though the age limit is completely ignored. (thanks M.)

It is illegal to sell tobacco or cigarettes to anyone under 16 and sellers must be licensed. Under the Children and Young Persons (Protection from Tobacco) Act of 1991 maximum fines for selling to under 16s were increased from BP400 to BP2,500.

doseText :: Nicotine is the primary psychoactive constituent of tobacco. It is found in cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and rolling tobacco, as well as in nicotine patches, gum, inhalers, and nasal spray.  It is important to note that nicotine-product users moderate their use of the products to adjust the level of their effects: smokers can hold the smoke for a shorter duration, let the cigarette burn longer between inhalations, not smoke an entire cigarette, or other similar techniques to make small adjustments to the dose of nicotine received from smoking.

There are differing standards for how to determine the "nicotine yield" from a smoked cigarette. The Massachusetts state government method for testing nicotine yield results in much higher reported doses: "the average from using the historical method was 0.90 mg/cigarette while the average from the Massachusetts method was 1.89 mg/cigarette." (Change in Nicotine Yields 1998-2004, MDPH).  The older method for testing cigarette nicotine yield showed nicotine dosages per cigarette in the .13 to 2.0 mg range, but the Massachusetts method shows nicotine yields between 1 mg and 3 mg. Actual nicotine delivery to a human can be and has been validated by testing urine of cigarette smokers, but this is a costly and time consuming procedure and is not used for determining nicotine yields for the available cigarette brands.  Research actually looking at the blood plasma of Cigarette smokers has shown that up to 3.0 mg of nicotine may be received from a single cigarette. (Benowitz 1998)  See The Nicotine and Tar content of 25 cigarette brands for a list of individual nicotine contents.  NICOTINE GUM Sold in 2.0 and 4.0 mg per piece of gum. In a 4.0 mg piece, 3.4 - 4.0 mg is considered bio-available (According to Physicians Desk Reference)  NICOTINE TRANSDERMAL PATCH Transdermal patches are sold designed to deliver nicotine slowly over 24 hours, with 21 mg, 14 mg, and 7 mg per patch, deliving around .88 mg, .58 mg, and .29 mg per hour for 24 hours. Some users and some researchers apply more than one patch at a time to achieve stronger effects. (Benowitz 1998)  REFERENCES  Perkins K, Fonte C, Sanders M, et al.
