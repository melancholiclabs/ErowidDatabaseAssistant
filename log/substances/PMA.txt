description :: PMA has been used as a recreational psychoactive (primarily in the 70s), at doses around 50 mg. Unfortunately, more often it has been sold as MDA or MDMA (ecstasy). The dosages for MDMA (80-160 mg) are significantly higher than those of PMA. At 60-80 mg, PMA can become extremely dangerous, causing increased blood temperature and blood pressure. In recent cases, PMA has been sold as ecstasy, in pressed pill form indistinguishable from ecstasy and at unknown dosages.

[Dose]
doseTable :: null
doseText :: Pure PMA is a white powder, but forms found on the street can also be somewhat beige, pink, or yellowish. Recently is has been found most frequently in pressed pill form sold as MDMA (ecstasy). There is very little available information about safe recreational dosages for PMA. Doses as low as 60 mg can cause significant and alarming increase in blood pressure, body temperature and pulse. The most concerning aspect of this is that if PMA is sold as ecstasy, some people will take multiple pills, increasing chances of a PMA overdose significantly.
