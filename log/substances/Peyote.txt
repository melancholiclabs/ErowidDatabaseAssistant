[Basics]
description :: Peyote (Lophophora williamsii) is a small button shaped cactus 2-5 inches in diameter, which grow in Mexico and the Southwest United States. Peyote is a hallucinogen, producing significant physical, visual, and perceptual changes. It is traditionally dried and eaten in a ritual setting to induce visions, and has been used by natives of Mexico for thousands of years.  Though Peyote is used recreationally by some, it is relatively uncommon on the street. Because a single Peyote button can take 5-15 years to mature, there is some concern about the over-harvesting of Peyote in the wild. [ Main Peyote Vault ]

[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Lophophora williamsii
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Scheduled
SCHEDULE	Schedule I
CLASSIFICATION	Hallucinogen
federalLawText :: Peyote (lophophora williamsii) is Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license.	
The CSA states:	
(22) Peyote Meaning all parts of the plant presently classified botanically as Lophophora williamsii Lemaire, whether growing or not, the seeds thereof, any extract from any part of such plant, and every compound, manufacture, salts, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or extracts (Interprets 21 USC 812(c), Schedule I(c) (12))	

Federal Native American Church Exemption	
TITLE 21-Food And Drugs	Administration, Department of Justice	PART 1307--MISCELLANEOUS--Table of Contents		Sec. 1307.31 Native American Church.	
The listing of peyote as a controlled substance in Schedule I does not apply to the nondrug use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native American Church, and members of the Native American Church so using peyote are exempt from registration. Any person who manufactures peyote for or distributes peyote to the Native American Church, however, is required to obtain registration annually and to comply with all other requirements of law.
stateLaw :: Arizona	Arizona has an exemption for "bona fide practice of a religious belief" in Title 13-3402. In a January 2014 article in the Phoenix New Times, a DEA agent said they deferred to local laws with regard to peyote. The author Eric Tsetsi writes : "Still, there's much controversy surrounding the legality of taking peyote, and if federal authorities wanted to prosecute Peyote Way for its use, cultivation, and distribution of the plant, they probably could make a case. Peyote Way Church technically is in violation of federal law, as neither Kent nor Zapf is Native American. Special Agent Sanchez, however, deferred to local and state authorities when asked about Peyote Way, suggesting that the DEA has taken a hands-off approach regarding peyote use, in the same way the Obama Administration recently has backed off going after medical-marijuana distribution in states including Arizona." (Jan 8 2014) See blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2014/01/arizona_church_peyote_way_hallucinogen.php?print=true. (Last Updated Jan 8 2014)
California	California law states that "every person who plants, cultivates, harvests, dries, or processes any plant of the genus Lophophora, also known as peyote, or any part thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than one year or the state prison." (Health & Safety Code:Ch.6,Art.3,Sec.11363) This is notable because the wording includes the entire Lophophora genus, not just Lophophora williamsii.
Utah	Utah Supreme Court ruled that peyote use in "bona fide" religious ceremonies, regardless of the race of the participants, is protected under Utah and Federal Law in Utah. The court wrote: "On its face, the exemption applies to members of the Native American Church, without regard to tribal membership. The bona fide religious use of peyote cannot serve as the basis for prosecuting members of the Native American Church under state law." See: Salt Lake Tribune, June 23 2004, Utah State Supreme Court Decision
internationalLaw :: Australia	Peyote is not fedearlly scheduled in Australia, but is controlled in the Australian Capital Territory (see Criminial Code and may be illegal in other territories as well. Import restrictions exist on the artichoke cactus (Obregonia denegrii), which is referred to in Australian law as "peyote". (see Wildlife Protection Act). (thanks T, DR, ET)
Brazil	Peyote (Lopsophoria williamsii) is listed as a controlled substance, making production, distribution, or possession illegal. (thanks P)
Canada	According to the 2001 Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (which replaced the older Narcotics Control Act) mescaline is listed as a schedule III drug, while peyote is specifically exempted from Canada's Controlled Substances list. However, if peyote is prepared for ingestion (ground, made into tea, etc), it is possible that it would be treated as "mescaline" rather than as "peyote" which could make the preparation illegal. See Ask Erowid for more info.
France	Peyote (Lophophora williamsii) was specifically added to the list of controlled substances in August 2004. [Reference]
Italy (Italia)	Listed in Tabella I of "Tabelle delle sostanze stupefacenti e psicotrope", making it illegal to possess, purchase, or sell. (see Tabelle delle sostanze stupefacenti e psicotrope. (thanks a) (last updated Dec 16, 2015)
Japan	We do not know the legal status of Peyote in Japan, but have been told that as of Jun 2005, it is available in headshops (3 buttons for Y12,000 or $110).
Mexico	Peyote is Schedule I in Mexico, although a few indigenous tribes are allowed to harvest it. Peyote is protected as an endangered species in Mexico and harvesting is controlled. (thanks M, I)
Netherlands	Peyote is not scheduled in the Netherlands in its fresh/live state (similar to fresh psilocybe mushrooms). Only "preparations" containing mescaline and psilo(cyb)in are scheduled although this is currently being debated in the courts with one vendor challenging the definition of dried magic mushrooms as a "preparation". See the Dutch Opium Act: http://www.cannabisbureau.nl/pdf/Opiumwet_EN_29nov2004.pdf. (thanks SS) (last updated Jun 2007)
Poland	We have been told that, according to 'Ustawa z dnia 29 lipca 2005 r. o przeciwdzia3aniu narkomanii' ( a bill concerning drug abuse and addiction), mescaline is scheduled IIP, which means that one can be sentenced to up to 3 years for possesion of mescaline in any form, unless they have special permit for research. (unconfirmed) (thanks M)
Russia	A new law on drug possession came into effect Sep 7 2004, banning seven new substances, including peyote. Anyone caught in possession of two or more adult-size Lophophora williamsii can be arrested and face up to two years in prison. See Moscow Times article (thanks CC)
Singapore	Peyote is not listed in the laws of Singapore, but mescaline is a Class A controlled drug. (unconfirmed) (thanks T)
South Korea	Several online vendors in South Korea carry peyote as a floral/decorative cactus, though we do not have any information about its legal status. (thanks J) (last updated Oct 6 2010)
Spain 	Peyote is reportedly sold in shops and by florists in Spain as an ornamental cactus. Sale and distribution are regulated by the 2006 "list of regulated plants". See http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/l29-2006.t2.html#a51 and http://todoesdroga.blogspot.com.es/2011/10/sobre-la-famosa-lista-de-plantas.html?zx=c433689d559fa0b7. (thanks vm) (last updated Jul 15 2015)
Switzerland	Peyote is listed as a prohibited substance in Switzerland. (see Liste des stup&eacute;fiants prohib&eacute;s (thanks V)
United Kingdom	In 2004, fresh (not dried) peyote buttons are currently sold fresh in shops across Britain. Currently, mescaline containing cacti are not controlled in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, there is no legal distinction between different species of mescaline-containing cacti, so peyote are controlled in the same way as San Pedro, for instance. See 2007 U.K. Trichocereus Cacti Legal Case for more information about the current legal status of mescaline-containing cacti in the United Kingdom. (thanks SS) (last updated Jun 2007)

doseText :: The peyote cactus contains mescaline as its primary active chemical, but also contains 50-60 other alkaloids. The alkaloid content (potency) of peyote buttons can vary greatly based on age, location, and season at harvest. Winter (January) is prime season with summer (June) showing lower levels. Though it has been suggested that some mescaline degrades as buttons dry, generally the same number of buttons are consumed, whether fresh or dried.  The above chart is based on average potency, mid-sized buttons (greater than 1 inch/2.5 cm in diameter when dried).
notes :: Mescaline content in dried buttons can reach 5-6% of total weight, but is more commonly now reported as 1-2% or less, perhaps because of a decrease in the average age of buttons at harvest. A dried peyote button may weigh 2-5 grams (2.5 grams for a dried mid-sized button approximately 1 inch/2.5 cm diameter). Mescaline accounts for approximately 30% of the alkaloids present. The percentage of mescaline content by weight in fresh buttons is much lower than in dry buttons because of the higher water content. Mescaline content in fresh buttons is approximately 0.2-0.3%.	
The alkaloid content appears to be highest at the top of the cactus, with the top half of the button reportedly somewhat more potent than the bottom half. The alkaloid content of fresh roots is approximately one quarter that of fresh whole buttons/tops. It is considered inappropriate to harvest and consume the roots because a root can regrow a new button after a button is harvested.	
Traditional peyote ceremonies continue for an entire night, with additional pairs of buttons eaten over time. Following are approximate single dosages (not including re-dosing) for fresh and dried peyote.
