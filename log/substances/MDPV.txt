neutralEffects :: stimulation (mental and physical)	mild elevation in heart rate
negativeEffects :: Hypervigilance and inappropriae-alerting on Visual and Auditory perceptions. Can trigger or be part of paranoid sensations. The inappropriate alerting is either from normal peceptual noise or hallucinaed visual or audio effects [effect common to all long acting stimulants and sleep deprivation.]	tightened jaw muscles, grinding teeth (trismus and bruxia)	reduced enjoyment of eating / loss of appetite	disturbed sleep patterns	involuntary body movements (twitching, lip-smacking, etc.)	confusion and/or scrambled thoughts	gastrointestinal disturbance	muscle tension	residual depressed mood	nystagmus / eye spasm	anxiousness / nervousness / paranoia	harsh comedown effects	fiending (redosing repeatedly without planning to do so)	excessive excitation / hyperactivity	headache	very elevated heart rate	hallucinations / psychotic behavior (at high doses or with repeated use)
description :: General Effects Notes	The effects of MDPV are usually compared to amphetamines or other stimulants. A rough comedown is frequently reported, occasionally leading to compulsion to redose.	
Routes of Administration	MDPV is most often taken via insufflation, though there are reports of it being orally ingested.	
Addiction and Compulsive Use	MDPV is known to be associated with compulsive use ("fiending") in a minority of reports. Because its use is so uncommon, no definitive statements about its use can be made.
experienceReports :: [4 mg insufflated] "I felt a mild euphoria, lightness in the head, and a bit speedy, but in a good way, wanting to get things done, rather than jittery and jumpy. Not a lot of feelings throughout the body, but rather in the head. [...] My creative writing skills are definitely enhanced, and I am sincerely enjoying the process of recording my thoughts to virtual paper. This is a good study aid perhaps, beneficial to writing research papers..." -- Exp 78708[3 mg insufflated] "Effects are starting to wear off, especially the happiness and euphoria. Still feeling energetic and have the need to do something. I feel the need to redose, however I control myself." -- Exp 68773[repeated insuff. redosing] "Doing/coming off of MDPV is like winning a Mercedes and being told at the last minute they got your name wrong. Uggh." -- Exp 62097[14 mg oral] "Hmm... heart-rate is back up at 86bpm. The mental/physical energy is totally gone. It's like I have been on a giant amusement park ride made of sparkly energy and the ride has slowly ground to a halt. Show's over. But the price to pay is this stubborn heart-rate issue. Tachycardia, my new friend. A racing, pounding heart in my chest. Not fun." -- Exp 74539[10 mg insuff. x 3] "Elevated blood pressure and pulse noted, slight pressure on the inside of my skull. Slightly anxious, but still in this centered, detached mood. Still wide awake. So far, it would have been impossible to sleep. Furthermore... Mild feelings of stiffness in the body. All in all, the comedown was perceived as very gentle despite the weird effects on my memory, which I really didn't care that much about. ... No problems remaining still like on some other stims. Rather, it had a couchlocking effect. In comparison with Amphetamine, this seems very mild indeed...." -- Exp 80490

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
