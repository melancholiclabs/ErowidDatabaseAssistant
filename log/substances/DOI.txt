[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
DOI
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
SCHEDULE	Likely Analog
federalLawText :: DOI is unscheduled in the United States. It is likely that it would be considered an analog (of DOB), in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act though we are unaware of any such existing cases (6/21/04). DOI is regularly used in animal and in vitro research, Scheduling DOI would impose substantial costs to brain research.
