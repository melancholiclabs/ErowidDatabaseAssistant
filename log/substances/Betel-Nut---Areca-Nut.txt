Native to SE Asia, the nuts are ground and often combined with mineral lime and wrapped in the leaf of a Betel pepper plant, although they are sometimes consumed buccally ('chewed') alone. Notably, frequent use can stain teeth black and its daily use is associated with increased risk of mouth cancers. Variants of the betel and lime combination are extremely common in many Asian cultures and have a long history of human use.

[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Areca catechu
REGULATED	No
STATUS	- - -
SCHEDULE	Un-Scheduled
federalLawText :: Betel Nut (Areca catechu) is uncontrolled in the United States. This means all parts of the plant and its extracts are legal to cultivate, buy, possess, and distribute (sell, trade or give) without a license or prescription. If sold as a supplement, sales must conform to U.S. supplement laws. If sold for consumption as a food or drug, sales are regulated by the FDA.	
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued an import alert resulting in automatic detention of betel if it is detected by U.S. Customs officers (IA #23-06; revised July 17, 1992). Likewise, the U.S. Department of Agriculture enforces a prohibition against importation of betel nuts, which seems to apply only to nuts in raw or unprocessed condition (51 Agric. Dec. 1278, 1992 WL 515928 (U.S.D.A.) and 7 C.F.R. ï¿½ 318.13). But there is also contradictory evidence which suggests that Betel Nuts may be legally imported in some forms. [Van McCrary, uh.edu]
