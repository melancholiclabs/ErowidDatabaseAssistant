[Basics]
description :: DMAE is an anti-oxidant and free radical deactivator which is found naturally in the human brain. It is thought to be the precursor for acetylcholine which conducts nerve impulses within the brain (a neurotransmitter). The theory is that by increasing the production of acetylcholine, DMAE can help improve memory and learning as well as perhaps reducing memory loss in older adults. Some individuals also report that DMAE causes a noticeable boost in their ability to concentrate.  One study of DMAE found that it increased the maximum lifespan of mice by up to 36.6%, and this has been widely reported and advertized by DMAE marketers. But later studies failed to confirm these results and may have found the opposite to be true. [ Main DMAE Vault ]
