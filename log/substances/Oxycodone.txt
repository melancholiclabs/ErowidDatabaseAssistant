description :: Oxycodone is an semi-synthetic opioid analgesic, used primarily in the treatment of pain. It saw a significant increase in recreational use when the higher-dose time-release form OxyContin was introduced in 1995. In 2005, Jakubska et al. published a finding that oxycodone is produced naturally by the shrub Epipactis helleborine.

[Basics]
description :: Oxycodone (Percocet, Oxycontin) is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic (pain killer) similar to morphine. Oxycodone is widely prescribed for the relief of moderate to severe pain, in both regular and time-release forms. It is widely available by prescription and is notoriously addictive, leading many users to have problems controlling their own use. [ Main Oxycodone Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	Oxycodone typically comes in different strengths, including: 5 mg capsules; 5, 10, 15, and 30 mg oral tablets; and 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg sustained-release tablets. Some people choose to grind and insufflate (snort) oxycodone tablets in order to get a stronger effect, however, the use of higher dose sustained-release tablets in this manner can be very dangerous.  An average adult dose is typically 5 mg every six hours. Tolerance develops very quickly; those who take it on a daily basis may find they need to increase their dosage in order to get the same effects. Higher doses, especially the 80 mg sustained-release tablets are for opioid-tolerant people only.
price	Prescription prices vary but have increased since the introduction of the gummy anti-injection/anti-snorting versions of Oxycodone tablets. Prices in the U.S. are in the range of $5-10 per 40 mg tablet in the United States (2013), with street prices around $1 USD per mg ($40 per 40mg tablet). Canadian prices are around 1.25-1.75 CDN per mg for OxyNeo and 2-2.5 CDN per millligram of oxycodone. much lower.
law	Oxycodone is available by prescription only in most countries. It is Schedule II in the United States, making it illegal to sell without a license and illegal to purchase or possess without a prescription.
chemistry	Oxycodone is an opioid analgesic, closely related chemically to opioids such as codeine and morphine.
pharmacology	As with most other opioids, oxycodone's mechanism of analgesic action is unknown. It is presumed to work by affecting opioid receptors found in the brain.
production	Most recreationally consumed oxycodone is diverted from prescription medical uses, rather than produced/manufactured illegally.
history	Oxycodone was first synthesized in 1916 in Germany and has been used therapeutically since shortly thereafter. It has been available in the United States since about 1939. It became more popular in the 1950s. It was placed into Schedule II in the U.S. in 1970. The sustained-release form (Oxycontin) has been available in the U.S. since 1995/6 and quickly gained popularity.
terminology	Brand Names:Percocet, Percodan, Endocodone, M-oxy, Oxycontin, Oxydose, OxyFAST, OxyIR, Percolone, Roxicodone, Roxicet, Supeudol, Tylox. The Substance:Oxy, Oxies, O.C.'s, Oxycottons, Oxy 80's, Hillbilly Heroin, Roxies, Percs. The Experience:Jammed.
effects :: Primary effects include analgesia (pain relief), sedation, reduction of anxiety, euphoria, and relaxation.
effectsSections :: onset	Effects are generally felt 10-30 minutes after oral ingestion, although it can take up to an hour to feel the full effects.
duration	Oxycodone, when taken orally (and not in sustained-release form) has effects that last last from 3 to 5 hours. Sustained-release tablets last up to 12 hours.
visuals	Rarely (less than 1% in clinical trials) oxycodone may result in changes in visual perception, or abnormal vision.
problems :: Side effects range from the common: constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, itching/pruritus, dry mouth, sweating, fatigue, and weakness; to the less common: impaired thinking, confusion, loss of appetite, nervousness, sleeplessness/insomnia, fever, diarrhea, difficulty urinating, clammy skin, light-headedness, and fainting; to the rare and very concerning: abdominal pain, seizures, convulsions, difficulty breathing, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and circulatory depression or shock.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Combining oxycodone with alcohol or other CNS depressants can lead to a dangerous slowing of the central nervous system and respiratory system. Other contraindications include:   those hypersensitive to opiates history of drug or alcohol abuse those with head injuries, increased intracranial pressure, seizures, asthma, COPD, prostatic hyperplassia, severe hepatic or renal disease, acute abdominal conditions, urethral stricture, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, or arrhythmias
addiction	Oxycodone is both physically and psychologically addicting. Anyone taking it, whether for recreational or medicinal reasons, may become addicted, especially if it is used on a daily basis. Tolerance is developed over a period of weeks, resulting in higher doses being needed to achieve the same effects. Withdrawal symptoms, including aches and pains, restlessness, nausea, anxiety, diarrhea, fever, headaches, runny nose, tremors, sweating, vomiting, and trouble sleeping, may be experienced by those ceasing use after regular and especially high-dose use.

description :: Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is most effective treating acute pain rather than chronic pain. The precise mechanism of action of oxycodone and other opiates is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system.

[Law]

Oxycodone
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Scheduled
SCHEDULE	Schedule II
CLASSIFICATION	Opiate
federalLawText :: Oxycodone is Schedule II in the United States. This means it is illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription.	
After high-dose oxycodone tablets as OxyContin were approved in 2005, the FDA revoked its approval of the original sustained-release formulation in 2010 because of the record of unapproved use. A re-engineered OxyContin product was released to try to make it harder to snort or inject and in April 2013, the FDA approved a newer formulation that is even harder to snort or inject. See http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm348252.htm.

doseText :: Oxycodone is available in several forms. Percocet contains between 2.5-10 mg oxycodone and 325-650 mg acetaminophen/paracetamol. Percodan most often contains 4.5 mg oxycodone and 325 mg aspirin. Oxycontin is a timed-release form that gradually releases oxycodone (10, 20, 40, 80, or 160 mg) over several hours when taken orally. Other formulations are available.

Because people quickly develop tolerance to the effects of oxycodone, dosages will vary dramatically depending on whether an individual has been using regularly, and for how long. Some new users report an alarming degree of sedation and nausea after taking 15 mg, while some chronic users report taking 200 mg or more a day.

Note that snorting any substance can result in injury to nasal passags, sinuses, throat, etc and crushed tablets include binders and inert ingredients that do not rapidly dissolve.
