[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Henbane
REGULATED	No
STATUS	- - -
SCHEDULE	Un-Scheduled
federalLawText :: Hyoscyamus niger is unscheduled in the United States, but it is also listed as a "poison" according to U.S.C. Title 21 Chapter 7. This designation as a poison means that most products made from henbane must either be labelled "for external use only"; or labelled as a "poison" and records kept about who it is sold to. The plant itself is legal to cultivate, buy, possess, and distribute (sell, trade or give) without a license or prescription.
stateLaw :: Louisiana	Effective Aug 8, 2005 (signed into law Jun 28, 2005) Louisiana Act No 159 makes 40 plants illegal, including Hyoscyamus niger, when intended for human consumption. The law specifically excludes the "possession, planting, cultivation, growing, or harvesting" of these plants if used "strictly for aesthetic, landscaping, or decorative purposes." (Text of HLS_05RS-52 and Update June 2005)
Tennessee 	Tennessee did not pass the proposed bill that would have banned dozens of plants as "hallucinogenic" when intended for human consumption. Instead, they banned only Salvia divinorum. See Comments on New State Laws Controlling the Consumption of Hallucinogenic Plants.
