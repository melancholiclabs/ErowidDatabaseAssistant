[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Alcohol
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Over-The-CounterAge Restricted
SCHEDULE	Un-Scheduled
federalLawText :: In the United States, alcohol sales are largely regulated at the state level. Although alcohol is available over-the-counter :	

All state laws restrict alcohol purchase to those who are 21 years old or older.	There is no federal law prohibiting consumption of alcohol by minors, and state laws vary.	It is legal to brew beer and ferment wine for personal consumption without a license.	In order to sell beer or wine, a license is required.	It is federally illegal to distill hard alcohol (even for personal consumption) without a license.	It is illegal in all states to operate vehicles with a blood alcohol content of 0.08%; however, levels lower than 0.08% are illegal in some states and/or some situations: BAC limits of 0.01% to 0.05% are in place in some states for drivers under 21 years old; on the federal level, for drivers operating a vehicle requiring a commercial driver's license the BAC limit is 0.04%; for drivers of common carriers (such as buses), the BAC limit is 0.01%.	



Spirits #	(from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms)	
"You cannot produce spirits for beverage purposes without paying taxes and without prior approval of paperwork to operate a	distilled spirits plant. [See 26 U.S.C. 5601 & 5602 for some of the criminal penalties.] There are numerous requirements that must	be met that make it impractical to produce spirits for personal or beverage use. Some of these requirements are paying special tax,	filing an extensive application, filing a bond, providing adequate equipment to measure spirits, providing suitable tanks and	pipelines, providing a separate building (other than a dwelling) and maintaining detailed records, and filing reports. All of these	requirements are listed in 27 CFR Part 19.	
Spirits may be produced for nonbeverage purposes for fuel use only without payment of tax, but you also must file an application,	receive ATF's approval, and follow requirements, such as construction, use, records and reports."

However, the WHO reports: "Religious minorities can buy alcoholic beverages from very few specifically licensed shops owned by shopkeepers of the same minority." An Erowid reader describes the law this way: "It is usually illegal to buy or sell alcohol in Iran, but there are some exceptions. Christians (Armenians), Jews, and some other minorities are allowed to sell alcoholic beverages. These minorities are also only supposed to sell alcohol to members of their own minority, but they don't really ask--or even care--about what your background is. A lot of non-minority Iranians drink, but they do it secretly." See WHO's Alcohol Policy PDF. (thanks K,S) (last updated Oct 6 2009)
