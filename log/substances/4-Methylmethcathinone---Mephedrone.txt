[Basics]
description :: 4-Methylmethcathinone is a synthetic stimulant with euphoric and empathogenic effects that gained popularity in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, and Europe between 2007 and 2009. The effects of 4-methylmethcathinone are often compared to those of MDMA, MBDB, bk-MDMA (methylone), cocaine, methamphetamine and other euphoric stimulants. Because of its short duration and intense rush, there are numerous reports of compulsive redosing, resulting in the use of more 4-methylmethcathinone than intended.  [ Main 4-Methylmethcathinone Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	A standard oral dose of 4-methylmethcathinone is between 75 and 200 mg. It is most frequently found as a powder, though a few tablets have been commercially produced.
price	As of November 2009, 4-methylmethcathinone is primarily sold online and is available for as low as $20 (USD) for a single gram, with bulk pricing as low as $15 (USD) per gram.
law	4-Methylmethcathinone is temporarily Schedule I in the United States and it would be considered an illegal analogue of methcathinone if intended for human consumption. 4-methylmethcathinone is controlled in a number of countries, including Australia, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
chemistry	4-Methylmethcathinone is a synthetic chemical similar in structure to methcathinone.
pharmacology	Pharmacology Summary Needed.
production	Production Summary Needed.
history	Little has been published about the history of 4-methylmethcathinone prior to its introduction into the world online markets in 2007. The first country to ban it by name was Israel in December 2007.
terminology	The Substance:Mephedrone, 4-MMC, Meow, M-Cat, Bubbles The Experience:unknown
effects :: 
effectsSections :: onset	Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, oral 4-methylmethcathinone generally takes 15-45 minutes to take full effect. On a full stomach, onset can be considerably slower. When insufflated, effects are usually felt within a few minutes and the peak is reached within 30 minutes or less.
duration	The primary effects of 4-methylmethcathinone last approximately 2-3 hours when taken orally. For many people there is an additional period of time (1-4 hrs) where it is difficult to go to sleep but where mood and mind-set are mostly back to baseline. It is quite common for users to report a strong urge to redose as the effects wane, between 45 and 120 minutes after initial ingestion. With lower levels of consumption, the day-after effects are relatively mild, with most users reporting light to no hangover. Heavy users report worrying neurological and vasoconstrictive symptoms that can last days or weeks.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: Nausea, teeth-clenching, compulsive redosing, heart palpitations, racing heart, increased blood pressure, and other effects of high dose stimulants.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Do not take 4-methlmethcathinone if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). Stimulants and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. At strong doses, do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. If you have a seizure or convulsive disorder or heart problems, you may be at higher risk for health problems when taking stimulants.
addiction	4-Methylmethcathinone is not likely to cause much physical dependence or withdrawal symptoms, but many users report difficulty controlling their own use within a short period of time. It is unknown whether use might lead to long-term psychological addiction and related problems, but it is likely that 4-methylmethcathinone could be one of a number of stimulants that are part of a pattern of stimulant overuse.
long	There have been reports of vasoconstriction with repeated dosing, including moderate to severe symptoms of tingling and numbness in the extremities, headache, light-headedness and worrisome skin discoloration.
death	Risks of death associated with stimulants usually involve cardiovascular problems, overheating, and dangerous drug interactions as well as accidents related to intoxication and multi-drug combinations. 4-methylmethcathinone has been associated with several deaths, but details of the circumstances of these incidents are scanty.

description :: General Effects Notes	The effects of 4-methylmethcathinone are often compared to those of MDMA, MBDB, bk-MDMA (methylone), cocaine, methamphetamine and other euphoric stimulants.	
4-methylmethcathinone does not include substantial psychedelic visual effects and is perhaps best known for its euphoric effects and reports of compulsive redosing.	
Routes of Administration	As with other psychoactives, oral 4-methylmethcathinone ingestion takes slightly longer to cause effects and lasts longer. Insufflation (snorting) is more associated with compulsive / addictive use patterns. Smoking 4-methylmethcathinone is not commonly reported.	
Addiction and Compulsive Use	Initial reports suggested that 4-methylmethcathinone was a "non-addictive" alternative to methamphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulants, but there is increasing evidence that it causes compulsive use patterns that are similar to or stronger than those of other recreational euphoric stimulants. It is unlikely to be physically addictive, meaning that withdrawal symptoms are minimal and likely not life threatening, but psychological addiction in some users seems likely to be a problem with this substance.
experienceReports :: "[...] [W]e simply kept going until there was nothing left. This is, according to me, the biggest danger with this drug; one doesn't seem to realize or even notice when one has crossed the line, until it's too late." -- Exp 76345"A very nice substance for me overall. My elocution was remarkably enhanced, communicative centers were gaping wide, very comfortable and relaxed stimulation, empathy was significant (even though the 'magic' has long since departed my MDMA experiences). Comedown was not painful, just so swift it left a vacuum in its wake. I overindulged in MDMA when I was first introduced to it, and now I may as well have three caffeine drinks as take a pill. This substance feels (for me) like its effects could be similarly degraded with over-use. I'll be abstaining as much as my will permits. " -- Exp 78080"Compared to MDMA, similar euphoria (when bombed [swallowed]), far more hornyness, a bit less empathy, no psychadelia (although light tends to prism after several redoses, I think this is just a serotonin effect) - but what was amazing is that the next day, I felt brilliant, like I hadn't done anything the previous night. I would also compare it to speed and coke a little in its stimulating effects, which were far more than MDMA on its own. [...] The euphoria was absolutely crazy. I looked in the mirror, my eyes were saucers. I felt giddy from how amazing I felt. Stroking my arm was like having an orgasm. It was about as mindblowing as my first 'e'." -- Exp 74276"I feel very similar to my first ever ecstasy pill. Feel a little bit disappointed that I've peaked and am now contemplating trying a little line intranasaly. I say why they say this is like Cocaine. It is VERY moreish. [...] I believe Mephedrone has overtaken MDMA as my favorite drug. This is something that I never thought possible. The only noticable down side for me was the short duration of action and a binge seems VERY likely if I had a large supply so I'll have to keep the amount I have on me pretty low. The euphoria was amazing, the empathy was great ( I had an overwhelming urge to phone ALL of my friends to have a little chat) and the mild stimulation was perfect, not too much, not too little, just right, making me feel just as comfortable having a little dance in my room as I was sat at the computer listening to music." -- Exp 77208"The first dose was pleasurable, but overall I regret buying such a large quantity. If there was magic here, I certainly lost it over the course of a couple of days. Worryingly, it was much more acutely psychologically addicting than MDMA/MDMA adulterated with methamphetamine, Bk-MBDB and the various piperazine combinations I've had (though I will certainly place my satisfaction with this above that of those nasty pipes or of Bk-MBDB!). Hell, I felt more like doing this the next day than I felt like getting to my cocaine, and that's even after having a bad experience." -- Exp 78758"[M]ephedrone really disappointed me. The initial come-up rush led me on to thinking I had stumbled upon something very special - then it dropped off. [...] It seems that few reports from Erowid and afar have mentioned a lack of euphoria, so it just goes to show that chemicals affect people uniquely. [...] At no point was I compelled to take more mephedrone, despite its reputation of being moreish." -- Exp 77309"Mephedrone Is a nice drug, the euphoria I experienced was extremely pleasurable and from what I remember I had a great time. Mixing Mephedrone with alcohol was a very bad idea I experienced a great deal of memory loss and this is not something that usually happens to me and the nausea of today is unbearable." -- Exp 76757

[Health]
notes :: null
deaths :: Several deaths in the U.K. and Europe have been attributed to the use of mephedrone. These include cases of mephedrone use alone as well as mephedrone combined with other substances.
warnings :: Vasoconstriction at High Doses. At least two reports have described what appears to be significant vasoconstriction (narrowing of arteries causing reduced blood flow) after repeated use of mephedrone over a six or more hour period with a cumulative dose of 600 mg in one case and 1.8 g in another. This vasoconstriction resulted in "bluing" of knees, legs, feet, arms, hands, lips, and face, a well as light-headedness.2   One case has been reported in the medical literature of 3.8 grams of mephedrone being injected I.M. The individual suffered heart palpitations, "blurred tunnel vision", chest pressure, sweating, and sympathomimetic toxicity (heart rate of 105 bpm, bp of 177/111, dilated pupils of 7 mm). He was treated with 1 mg oral lorazepam and released from the hospital after 6 hours. Toxicology tests confirmed that the material was mephedrone.3 It is possible that the treatment with lorazepam prevented more significant vasoconstriction in this case.
Stimulant Combinations. Avoid other strong stimulants in combination with mephedrone, which can increase heart rate and blood pressure risks.
cautions :: Heart/Health Conditions. Individuals with a history of heart ailments, high blood pressure, aneurism or stroke may be at higher risk.
Frequent use. Many people have reported using more mephedrone than they intended. Often this takes the form of continuing to redose repeatedly after they had planned to stop.
Hyponatremia. In the case of one death in Sweden, medical reports show that prior to death the woman was suffering from hyponatremia, an electrolyte or salt deficiency in the body which has also been associated with the use of MDMA/ecstasy. While there isn't enough evidence to make a formal tie between mephedrone and hyponatremia, eating a salty snack or sports drink can help reduce this potential risk.

[Dose]
doseTable :: 4-Methylmethcathinone Dosages
Oral
Threshold	15 - 50 mg
Light	50 - 100 mg
Common	100 - 200 mg
Strong	150 - 300+ mg
doseText :: 4-Methylmethcathinone is a stimulant with empathogenic qualities that is a little less potent than MDMA by mass. As of 2009, it is most often found as a powder, though some tablets have been pressed that include 4-methylmethcathinone.
notes :: Many reports of 4-methylmethcathinone use involve redosing ("boosting" / "bumping") multiple times. Users sometimes mix oral and insufflated, taking some 4-methylmethcathinone orally, then insufflating some, then taking more orally. Because of the common desire to recapture the pleasurable initial high, redoses are sometimes higher than the initial dose or are spaced closely together in time. Many users report having difficulty not redosing after using a strong dose if more 4-methylmethcathinone is available when they are starting to come down. Experience reports in which users find themselves unexpectedly consuming a gram or more of 4-methymethcathinone are common.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
