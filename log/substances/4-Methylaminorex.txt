[Basics]
description :: 4-methylaminorex is a long-lasting synthetic stimulant which is generally found in the form of either crystals or powder which are taken orally, smoked, or insufflated. It is often touted for its use as a work-drug, especially when writing or working on long projects. It is also noted for providing somewhat more euphoria (hence the slang name U4Euh) than other stimulants such as caffeine or amphetamine. 4-methylaminorex use has never been particularly widespread and the material is rarely seen on the street market.

descriptionSections :: dose	A standard dose of 4-methylaminorex seems to run between 10 and 25 mg regardless of ingestion method (oral, insufflated or smoked). Ingestion method primarily affects the duration of the experience with smoking providing the shortest duration and oral the longest.
price	Price Summary Needed.
law	4-methylaminorex is illegal to possess and sell in the United States (schedule I). It was scheduled in the U.S. in 1987.
chemistry	Chemistry Summary Needed.
pharmacology	Pharmacology Summary Needed.
production	Production Summary Needed.
history	4-methylaminorex was first synthesized by George Poos in the early 1960s and was studied for its appetite suppressant effects. It gained some popularity for recreational use during the early 1980s and was emergency scheduled in 1987.
terminology	The Substance:Ice; Euphoria; U4Euh; Intellex; 4-MAR; U4EA; EU4EA. The Experience:No common terms known.
effects :: Effects Summary Needed.
effectsSections :: onset	Onset depends on the method of ingestion. Onset after oral use can take up to 2 hours. Onset after insufflation takes approximately 30 minutes, while effects from smoking take 1-2 minutes.
duration	There is some discrepancy in the reported duration of 4-methylaminorex. Traditionally it has been described as a "long-lasting" stimulant which reported effects lasting 14-16 hours after oral use. Others describe the primary effects as lasting 4-6 hours with noticeable lingering effects lasting another 12-24. Dose and method of ingestion will significantly effect duration.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: Pulmonary hypertension has been strongly associated with Aminorex and may be associated with the ingestion of 4-methylaminorex as well. A propensity towards negative (and violent) experiences has been noted when 4-methylaminorex is combined with LSD.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Do not take 4-methylaminorex if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). 4-methylaminorex and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. If you have a seizure or convulsive disorder or heart problems, you may be at higher risk for health problems when taking 4-methylaminorex.

[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
4-Methylaminorex
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Scheduled
SCHEDULE	Schedule I
CLASSIFICATION	Stimulant
federalLawText :: 4-methylaminorex is Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license.	
The list of Schedule I drugs in the U.S. includes "(+/-)cis-4-methylaminorex", which is strangely over-specific. 4-Methylaminorex has four stereoisomers + and - cis-4-methylaminorex and + and - trans-4-methylaminorex. As Schedule I currently reads, the trans-isomers would not be strictly in Schedule I, though would clearly qualify as Controlled Substance Analogues if intended for human consumption.
