internationalLaw :: Australia	BZP is controlled nationally in Australia and is also specifically listed in most Australian states. The Australian National SUSDP's rulings are automatically added to each state's laws, thus BZP is controlled in every Australian state. Although the state-by-state listings of chemicals is mostly a point of trivia and not very important to the legal situation, it appears that BZP and TFMPP are scheduled in the highest drug restriction schedule in Vic, NSW, SA, NT and Qld. (thanks TW of http://shaman-australis.com.au/)

"Member States shall take the necessary measures, in accordance with their national law, to submit 1-benzylpiperazine (also known as 1-benzyl-1,4-diazacyclohexane, N-benzylpiperazine or - less precisely - as benzylpiperazine or BZP) to control measures proportionate to the risks of the substance, and criminal penalties, as provided for under their legislation complying with their obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances."

The law takes effect on Apr 1, 2008, banning sales immediately but giving the public six months to legally possess up to 5 grams or 100 tablets before they are completely banned.
