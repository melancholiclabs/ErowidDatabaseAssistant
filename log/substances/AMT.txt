[Basics]
description :: AMT is a psychedelic amphetamine-tryptamine first developed in the 1960's for anti-depressant research , although it was never very successful as a prescription antidepressant. Its effects usually last 8-14 hours when swallowed and 3-6 hours when insufflated. Its effects are often characterized as a cross between a psychedelic and an MDMA, with empathogenesis and strong physical stimulation common. One common side effect with both insufflated and oral ingestion of AMT is powerful nausea and associated vomiting. [ Main AMT Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	A standard oral dose of AMT is between 15 - 60 mg.
price	Rare, but sometimes sold at events for 5-20$ per dose, available from exotic chemical suppliers for 100-150$ per gram, aproximately the same from underground sources. (August 2000)

See http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3277/introduction/made. Previously AMT was not controlled in Britain and does not fall under the substituted tryptamine rule because its 'substitution' is not on the nitrogen. See the 2001 Misuse of Drugs Act : Schedule 1, regulation 3 (as of Mar 2004). AMT is still (2015) not listed in the UK laws, but is now controlled as a substituted tryptamine under Schedule 1 (not the same as USA Schedule I). (last updated Jan 3, 2015)

Threshold5 - 15 mg
Light10 - 25 mg
Common20 - 40 mg

Onset : 60 - 180 minutes
Peak : 3 - 5 hours
Duration : 10 - 14 hours (higher doses seem to last longer)
Normal After Effects : 1 - 5 hours
doseText :: Warning! Because AMT's effects can take over 2 hours to fully develop, a common error is to redose (add more) thinking that the initial dose was too low. This has lead to a number of very unpleasant and potentially dangerous overdose experiences. Those who have made this error recommend waiting until at least 2.5 hours after the initial dose to add more.
