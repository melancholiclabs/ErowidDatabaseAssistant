[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Codeine
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Scheduled
SCHEDULE	Schedule II, III when < 90mg / unit, V when < 200mg/100gm
CLASSIFICATION	- - -
federalLawText :: Codeine is Schedule II in the United States. This means it is illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription.	
Products such as Tylenol II-IV, which contain less than 90 mg codeine per dosage unit, are Schedule III. Products with less than 200 milligrams per 100 grams (or milliters) of dosage unit are Schedule V and are much less restricted.	
In January 2014, the FDA announced that they were going to begin new, additional enforcement against unapproved prescription drugs in the US that contain codeine. See https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/01/10/2014-00257/unapproved-and-misbranded-oral-and-injectable-drugs-labeled-for-prescription-use-containing-codeine#print_view. Apparently drug manufacturers had been producing new, commercially-available compounded products that had not gone through the FDA's rigorous new product approval process.
