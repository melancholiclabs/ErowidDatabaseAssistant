description :: General Effects Notes	2C-I-NBOMe shares some chemical structural similarity to 2C-I and is a very potent 5HT2A agonist with active doses under 1 milligram (1000 ug). Its effects have been compared to 2C-I, LSD, and DOI. There are some reports that effects can be very unpredictable, even with the same person taking the same dose at different times.	
Surprisingly, many reports state that 2C-I-NBOMe does not suppress appetite, cause dry mouth, or make food taste too strange to ingest. Appetite suppression is common on euphoriants and psychedelics and 2C-I-NBOMe seems distinct from LSD, DOI, and 2C-I in this regard.	
There have been several reports of users of 25C-NBOMe and 25I-NBOMe experienced peripheral vasocontriction that required medical attention. Symptoms begin with tingling, coldness, bluing, and numbness in the fingers, toes, lips, nose, and other extremities. Swelling in the hands, feet, and face have been reported. One user reported numbness lasting more than a week after use.	

Addiction and Compulsive Use	Though some reports mention that re-dosing is possible, its duration and psychedelic qualities make compulsive use seem unlikely. However, because its use is so new and uncommon, no definitive statements about it can yet be made.
experienceReports :: [750 ug, sublingal] "I was laughing hysterically at everything R is saying, and vise versa. The OEV's/CEV's are incredibly intricate an unavoidable. Definitely an incredibly detailed and layered fractal pattern. I am most certainly in a profound psychedelic headspace (i.e. I intuitively understand the universe, society, etc.) [...] It's much more of a pure psychedelic than it's non-benzyl substituted cousin 2C-I, while still retaining some of the entactogen qualities." -- Exp 93342[500-1000 ug, smoked] "The lack of mind-fuck makes it easier to deal with how incredibly high I instantly get when I freebase it. The visuals are amazing and I've only just scratched the surface. The body high is excellent and very smooth, no jitters that I've notice or anyone I've shared this with. It may not give me any insights or spiritual awakenings, but if I we're really being honest, most of us I think are really after exactly what this chem offers." -- Exp 95033[3750 ug, sublingual] "[T]he visuals were basically tangible. I could wave my hand in the air and felt as if I was playing with the energy surrounding me, it was absolute nirvana. I remember thinking to myself what a success the blotters had been, as I was laying in my bed in complete darkness staring at my hand, but having the best time of my life. A lot of the visuals consisted of infinite numbers of random shapes, all very reminiscent of the Matrix coding, just much more colorful and happy feeling. There were also massive amounts of trailing, I could wave my hand around in the air creating the most beautiful disturbances in the fields of energy all around me. It was like when you splash in the water and create all the ripples, except this was just air. Everything I would do in the world was just so beautiful, I thought to myself I couldn't believe I was surrounded by this beauty all day everyday, I just have to remind myself it's there even when I can't see it. I can't describe enough how interactive these visuals are, it's seriously unreal." -- Exp 93644[1000 ug, sublingual] "I loved how easy the comedown was. When I layed down, I was expecting the constant chatter/closed eye visuals I usually get, but my thinking was clear and it was pretty easy for me to fall asleep." -- Exp 94200[2 blotter hits, buccal, 2 lines, insufflated] "Wow! visuals are crazy and the music is intense, waves of 3D objects have taken over my living room and everything looks beautiful! [...] Amazing party drug! I don't feel very stimulated even though this is a psychedelic stimulant? But euphoria I feel quite allot and this is a really social drug although on high doses its a bit hard to have a real conversation." -- Exp 95008[1 blotter hit, sublingual/buccal] "25I is probably the most stereotypical/recreational psychedelic drug I have ever used, and I've used quite a few psychedelics. 25I makes me feel good, I have insane visuals, and it doesn't disrupt with my language abilities (that much). It is almost nothing like 2C-I. Just because it has a 16x greater potency for the 5-HT2a receptor DOES NOT mean that this compound is just a 16x more potent version of 2C-I. In my opinion, 25I was more comparable to LSD/shrooms, than any phenethylamine I have used. However, despite its high recreational value, I do not consider this drug profound on the level of shrooms, Ayahuasca, or salvia." -- Exp 93884[1500 ug, buccal] "CEV strong, really strong. Abrupt changes in ambient lighting cause rapid strobing. Strong erotic component to music, something in it and the feel of the rug and the sensation was really pushing me close to ecstasy a minute ago." -- Exp 93870[1000 ug, insufflated] "There's a HEAVY sexual pull which I've yet to read about in other trip reports [...] I feel indescribable pleasure. Bliss. Nirvana. This is the ultimate human experience. My life up until this point has merely been preparation for this moment. Everything from here on afterwards will never be the same. I literally FEEL the beauty of the universe in its infinite complexity. My perception of myself is erased. There is no longer a 'me'. [...] This is one of the best if not THE BEST drug ever made. It would be almost impossible to improve. I am done searching for the perfect psychedelic; this is the one. Both low and high doses are extremely comfortable and get more rewarding as the dosage is pushed higher. Under its influence at relatively high doses there was no nausea, no anxiousness, and absolutely no fear." -- Exp 95009[2000 ug, insufflated] "[T]he visuals totally absorbed my consciousness. Every moment would be "Oh my god! Why are there some many people roaming the woods?" or "SHIT, the ground is splitting open!". The path would seem to wind away into the sky or my friends would seem to be sucked into the ground. Everything including the trees, bushes, sky, and water would melt together to create one single image. [...] Almost every shadow I saw would turn into the image of a human, and artificial source of light would look like an eye. I started hearing people talk to me, feeling animals perch on my shoulder. Basically I just started hallucinating a bunch of things for no reason at all." -- Exp 92752[1mg, buccal] "The closed eye visuals were calming, expansive, and beautiful. Many of the images reminded me of some drawings of animals by Native Americans. [...] As I sent it, memories of my childhood with her flashed through my mind, and I felt an enormous sadness thinking about how sad I imagine she felt when I left home for college. I cried for a good minute or two, and it felt wonderful." -- Exp 95147[5 blotter hits, buccal] "My body felt like shit. I wasn't sure if I was going to shit or puke myself all over the couch or wherever I was. [...] In the meantime I could barely move, I felt like I had drank an entire bottle of vodka. But everything around me had gone to absolute crazy town. I mean, I completely lost sanity. There was no coherent theme, there was nothing to keep track of, everything just went absolutely fucking haywire bananas, there was no reality, just crazy morphing walls and images popping into and out of vision a bazillion times a second." -- Exp 94045[1500 mcg, sublingual] "I saw rainbow prisms coming off of every object - similar to looking at a streetlight at night, but in broad daylight. I also had a significant "disco ball" effect - small spots of light on every surface." -- Exp 93624

[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
NBOMe Series
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Scheduled
SCHEDULE	I
federalLawText :: On Nov 13, 2015, the DEA extended the emergency scheduling of 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe by one year, until Nov 2016.	
On Nov 15, 2013, the DEA added 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe to Schedule I using their emergency scheduling powers, making those NBOMe compounds "temporarily" in Schedule I for two years. It is nearly guaranteed that after two years, these will be permanently added to Schedule I. Having these three chemicals in Schedule I also makes the rest of the NBOMe series probable Controlled Substance Analogues when intended for human consumption. For these three compounds sales, possession, manufacture, and distribution are all crimes under US law.	
In June 2013, Erowid was contacted by an individual saying they were being prosecuted under the Analogue Act for distribution of 25I-NBOMe (unconfirmed). In mid 2013, there was an ongoing federal case in the U.S. by the Department of Homeland Security attempting to prosecute 25I-NBOMe under the federal analog act. [erowid private correspondence with defendant]	
An informal evaluation by Robert Block of Wisconsin's Controlled Substances Board in September 2011 stated that he believed 25I-NBOMe to qualify as an analog of 2C-I (a Schedule I controlled substance in Wisconsin). "I would like to first make clear that all statements made to your questions are 'MY' opinion and I am neither speaking on behalf of the Wisconsin Crime Laboratories or the Controlled Substances Board (I am the current Chair of CSB). [...] It is my opinion that 25I-NBOMe would qualify as an analog of 2C-I [...]."	See drl.wi.gov/board_docview.asp?docid=247&boardid=12&locid=0.	
One technical note about 25-*-NBOMe legal status: The primary (easiest) synthetic route for producing 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe uses the related controlled substance (2C-I, 2C-C, and 2C-B, respectively) as the precursor chemical. It is likely that NBOMe-compounds sourced from lower-end sources might also contain tiny, detectable amounts of these controlled substance.

[Dose]
doseTable :: 2C-I-NBOMe Dosages
Sublingual/Buccal
Threshold	50 - 250 ug (micrograms)
Light	200 - 600 ug
Common	500 - 800 ug
Strong	700 - 1500 ug
doseText :: 2C-I-NBOMe is most commonly found in powder form, but is also mixed into liquid as well as dropped onto blotter paper (due to its extremely low doses). An additional complication is that some 2C-I-NBOMe is sold as freebase, some as HCl, and some as pre-"complexed" material that is mixed with a substance (HPBCD) designed to make 2C-I-NBOMe more soluble in water and therefore bioavailable. These different forms will all have different total masses per active dose.  Because of the different forms available, some pre-dosed onto blotter, it is difficult to provide consistent dosage information.
notes :: Due to its potency, misjudging the dose of 2C-I-NBOMe carries very real risks. A substantial dosage error could lead to undesirable or dangerous effects. If 2C-I-NBOMe is in pure powder form, small breezes, accidental inhalation, or touching the eyes or mouth after handling could result in full-blown effects or dangerous overdoses. Because of these dangers, 2C-I-NBOMe powder should be labeled clearly and handled with laboratory methods (goggles, gloves, mask) to minimize risks.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
