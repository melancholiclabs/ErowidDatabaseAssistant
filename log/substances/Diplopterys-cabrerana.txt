legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Diplopterys cabrerana
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Ambiguous
SCHEDULE	ContainsSchedule I Chemical
CLASSIFICATION	Hallucinogen
federalLawText :: Diplopterys cabrerana is not specifically a controlled species in the United States. Live plants and seeds are bought and sold and are not generally considered illegal. However, DMT, one of the chemicals contained in the plant, is Schedule I in the U.S. Practically, this means that if an extraction is done on DMT containing Diplopterys species, the resulting DMT is illegal to possess.	
Large scale (especially commercial) extraction of DMT from Diplopterys species falls into the realm of "clearly illegal" and would very likely be prosecuted. We are also aware of one case in which a relatively large quantity of Diplopterys cabrerana was imported into the U.S. and stopped at the border by customs. The individual who attempted to import it is being prosecuted for importation of a schedule I substance. The case has yet to be decided.

internationalLaw :: France	As of May 3, 2005, France added Banisteriopsis caapi, Peganum harmala, Psychotria viridis, Diplopterys cabrerana, Mimosa hostilis, Banisteriopsis rusbyana, harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine (THH), haroml, and harmalol to the list of controlled substances. See France Control Ayahuasca Plants and Chemicals. Earlier, in Jan 2005, a Paris court of appeals determined that Ayahuasca is not considered a preparation of DMT and is therefore not a controlled substance.
