description :: Ergot is a fungus that infects cereal grains, replacing kernels of the fruit with small black masses of mycelium. It produces ergotamine, a potent vasoconstrictor and precursor to LSD. Ergot poisoning (St Anthony's Fire) causes hallucinations, gangrenous loss of limbs, and death. Outbreaks plagued medieval Europe and were associated with witchcraft and the Inquisition.

[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Ergot
REGULATED	No
STATUS	- - -
SCHEDULE	Un-Scheduled
federalLawText :: Claviceps purpurea is unscheduled in the U.S., but it is also listed as a "poison" according to U.S.C. Title 21 Chapter 7. This designation as a poison means that products made from ergot must either be labelled "for external use only"; or labelled as a "poison" and records kept about who it is sold to. The fungus itself is legal to cultivate and possess.	
One of its constituent chemicals, ergotamine tartrate, is a watched chemical because of its use in the manufacture of LSD. Because of this, the cultivation or possession of large quantities of Claviceps purpurea might be considered suspicious.
stateLaw :: null
internationalLaw :: Brazil	Strangely, Claviceps paspali Stevens & Hall is included on the "Lista de Plantas que Podem Originar Subst&acirc;ncias Entorpecentes e/ou Psicotr&oacute;picas", but C. purpurea is not. Several ergot alkaloids are independently controlled in Brazil, including ergotonmine and LSA. (see schedule).
