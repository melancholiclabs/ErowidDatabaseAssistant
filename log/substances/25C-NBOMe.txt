description :: General Effects Notes	2C-C-NBOMe is chemically related to 2C-C and is a very potent 5HT2A agonist with active doses in the 200-700 microgram range. Its effects have been compared to 2C-C and LSD. There are some reports that effects can be very unpredictable, even with the same person taking the same dose at different times.	
There have been several reports of users of 25C-NBOMe and 25I-NBOMe experienced peripheral vasocontriction that required medical attention. Symptoms begin with tingling, coldness, bluing, and numbness in the fingers, toes, lips, nose, and other extremities. Swelling in the hands, feet, and face have been reported. One user reported numbness lasting more than a week after use.	
Addiction and Compulsive Use	Though some reports mention that re-dosing is possible, compulsive use seems unlikely. However, because its use is so new and uncommon, no definitive statements about it can yet be made.
experienceReports :: [500 mcg, insufflated] "The unremarkable room I'm in is suddenly transfigured into a Van-Goghian masterpiece. Looking out the window, the world has come alive, flowing in wavy brushstrokes. Visual trails leave clearly discernible ribbons of color in the air. I am completely enraptured by the stunning visual effects. My entire sensory experience takes on full salience. Every sight, sound, and smell enters my conscious awareness with unfiltered vitality." -- Exp 90724[1.4 mg, insufflated] "I realized the moment I stepped into the next room that things were warped and wrong, no way I could vape. I glanced at the clock, and less than 4 minutes had taken place since insufflation. I was already becoming overwhelmed with confusion and slight delirium, I knew by the unnaturally immediate and incredibly strong onset that the 'Effective' dose I had given myself was much, much, much greater than anything I had ever gotten before." -- Exp 88985

[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
2C-C-NBOMe
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Scheduled
SCHEDULE	I
federalLawText :: On Nov 13, 2015, the DEA extended the emergency scheduling of 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe by one year, until Nov 2016.	
On Nov 15, 2013, the DEA added 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe to Schedule I using their emergency scheduling powers, making those NBOMe compounds "temporarily" in Schedule I for two years. It is nearly guaranteed that after two years, these will be permanently added to Schedule I. Having these three chemicals in Schedule I also makes the rest of the NBOMe series probable Controlled Substance Analogues when intended for human consumption. For these three compounds sales, possession, manufacture, and distribution are all crimes under US law.	
One technical note about 25-*-NBOMe legal status: The primary (easiest) synthetic route for producing 25I-, 25C-, and 25B-NBOMe uses the related controlled substance (2C-I, 2C-C, and 2C-B, respectively) as the precursor chemical. It is likely that NBOMe-compounds sourced from lower-end sources might contain tiny, detectable amounts of a controlled substance. Depending on amount and legal venue, that trace amount could affect the legality of the whole batch.

[Dose]
doseTable :: 2C-C-NBOMe Dosages
Insufflated
Threshold	25 - 50 ug
Light	75 - 250 ug
Common	250 - 500 ug
Strong	500 - 700 ug
doseText :: 2C-C-NBOMe is most commonly found in powder form, but is also mixed into liquid as well as dropped onto blotter paper (due to its extremely low doses). We have very few reports of 2C-C-NBOMe usage, so dosages and durations are not well known. Some blotter reportedly contains 400 ug on each perforated hit.
notes :: Due to its potency, misjudging the dose of 2C-C-NBOMe carries very real risks. A substantial dosage error could lead to undesirable or dangerous effects. If 2C-C-NBOMe is in in pure powder form, small breezes, accidental inhalation, or touching the eyes or mouth after handling could result in full-blown effects or dangerous overdoses. Because of these dangers, 2C-C-NBOMe powder should be labeled clearly and handled with laboratory methods (goggles, gloves, mask) to minimize risks.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
