Israel	Cathinone, Cathine, and Methcathinone were added to the list of controlled Dangerous Drugs in early November, 2004 after cathinone was sold in capsules "Hagigat" and several people were reported to have required medical attention. See Haaretz.com. See Psychoactives Law : Israel. Further, Israel banned four "families" of substances and their derivatives in July 2010. The families are cathinones, methcathinones, amphetamines, and methamphetamines. The new rules are designed to preemptively ban new drugs before they are sold in Israel.
