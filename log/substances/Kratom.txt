[Basics]
description :: Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tropical tree growing from 15-50 feet tall (5-15 meters) that is native to Thailand and Malaysia. It has broad, oval leaves that taper to points, yellow flowers that grow in clusters, and winged seeds. The primary active chemicals are mitragynine, mitraphylline, and 7-hydroxymitragynine, all found in the leaves. Kratom leaves have been chewed for stimulant, sedative, and euphoric effects by people in Thailand and South Asia for centuries. They can also be smoked, brewed as a tea, or made into an extract. Kratom use is relatively uncommon in the US and Europe, though it is available in raw and extract-enhanced forms from ethnobotanical vendors. [ Main Kratom Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	Kratom leaves differ greatly in potency, depending on the type, grade, and freshness. Leaves with green veins are often claimed to be more potent than those with red veins, but there is contradictory evidence. Low doses are around 2-4 g of plain dried leaf, moderate doses are 3-6 g, and strong doses are 5 g or more. When chewed fresh, half of a large leaf (8-10") is often enough to produce noticeable effects.
price	Dried, untreated leaves are available from ethnobotanical vendors for 30-80 cents (USD)/gram. Higher potency extracts may cost $2-8 USD/gram. (2009 data)
law	Kratom is currently uncontrolled in the United States. In 1946 it was made illegal to buy, sell, or grow in Thailand, and in 2005, both M. speciosa and mitragynine were made illegal to buy, sell or possess without a license in Australia.
chemistry	Kratom leaves contain the indole alkaloids mitragynine, mitraphylline, 7-hydroxymitragynine, and numerous other alkaloids, including paynanthine, speciogynine, and speciofoline. Mitragynine has traditionally been cited as the primary active chemical in kratom leaves, but some recent evidence points to 7-hydroxymitragynine instead.
pharmacology	Mitragynine is a partial agonist of the mu- and delta-opioid receptors. This may account for its apparent efficacy in treating opiate withdrawal (see Babu et al. 2008). Because kratom acts as both a stimulant and a sedative, secondary alkaloids may be pharmacologically important.
production	Kratom grows wild in marshy regions in Asia and the Pacific Rim, especially Thailand, Malaysia, Borneo, and New Guinea.
history	Kratom appears to have been used in Thailand for centuries, recreationally and as an antidiarrhetic. Its use as an opiate substitute in Malaysia was reported in the nineteenth century. Peasants have used it to counteract the tedium of physical labor, similar to the use of coca in South America. The chemistry of its alkaloids was investigated in the 1920s, and mitragynine was isolated in 1923. Kratom leaves became part of the ethnobotanical trade in the United States and Europe in mid 2000. In the early 2000s, stories about the use of kratom to reduce opiod withdrawal effects began circulating on web forums.
terminology	The Substance:Kratom; Mitragyna speciosa; Ketum; Kakuam; Ithang; Thom. The Experience:No common terms known.
effects :: Kratom is often described as producing simultaneous, contradictory effects. Users report both an opiate-like sedation and coca-like stimulation. The stimulating effects tend to predominate at low dose levels, which may cause alertness, energy, and mild euphoria. Higher doses tend to be more tranquilizing, causing an opiate-like dreamy reverie. Excessive doses can cause severe nausea. Kratom is sometimes used as an opium substitute and has been found to suppress symptoms of opiate withdrawal. As with opium, it is known for causing constipation, and is sometimes used as a treatment for diarrhea.
effectsSections :: onset	When taken orally, kratom effects typically become noticeable in 15-20 minutes and clearly apparent in 30-60 minutes. Strong doses may have a more rapid and dramatic onset.
duration	A moderate kratom dose can cause strong effects lasting 2-4 hours, though residual effects can last hours longer. Users sometimes experience an afterglow the next day.
visuals	Some visual effects are reported, including both open-eye and closed-eye effects, though they are considered fairly mild if they occur at all. Effects reported include wavering, shifting, and strobing in the visual field; some patterning with eyes closed; and increased closed-eye visualizations.
problems :: Kratom is not known to be toxic, but it can be quite unpleasant at high doses, causing nausea and vomiting. Regular use can lead to physical dependency. Kratom use can cause constipation similar to that caused by opiates. Chronic heavy use is reported to cause darkening of skin, insomnia, dry mouth, and anorexia.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Do not operate heavy machinery. Do not drive. Care should be taken if combining with other sedatives (or stimulants). Use extreme caution if combining with MAO inhibitors. Kratom could be dangerous to combine with an MAOI.
addiction	There are reports of physical dependency after frequent, heavy kratom use. Individuals who use it regularly or in large doses may find it difficult to stop. Withdrawal symptoms include irritability, yawning, diarrhea, runny nose, and pain in the joints or muscles.
long	Long Term Health Problems Summary Needed.
death	There is one case in the medical literature in which kratom is believed to have contributed to the death of a 17-year-old male. Because he was alone, the exact cause of death could not be fully verified, however the medical examiner certified the cause of death as "possible Kratom toxicity". (Neerman et al. 2012) Animal studies have found even very large doses of mitragynine (920 mg/kg) to be non-lethal.

[Health]
notes :: Kratom leaves contain psychoactive chemicals, including mitragynine, that are mu-opioid agonists with some similarity in effects to opium-poppy opiates and pharmaceutical opioids. The primary health concerns for most users are sedation-related risks, addiction/dependence, constipation, itchiness, and possible liver health problems.
deaths :: We know of no documented deaths directly attributable to kratom, but some products sold as kratom have resulted in death. One death documented in a 2011 paper described a kratom product that also had O-desmethyltramadol (a synthetic pharmaceutical) added to it.1	
According to Pascal Tanguay, from the Thailand offices of PSI, a Washington DC-based global health organization that promotes harm reduction among drug users, "There's never been a single death associated with kratom. People have been chewing this for thousands of years with no cases of overdose, psychosis, murder, violent crime. Never in all of recorded history."2
warnings :: null
cautions :: Liver Toxicity / Hepatotoxicity / Hepatitis.  A small number of kratom experience reports describe hepatitis and/or hepatotoxic symptoms. This effect has also been reported in the medical literature (Kapp et al. 2011). Most of these reports of liver-health issues involve kratom extracts rather than unenhanced dried leaves. It is unknown if these are attributable to kratom alkaloids, extract-production byproducts, or other contaminants. See Sly 2008, Nlogn 2011, Experience Reports with mentions of liver issues.
Habituation / Addiction.  Kratom is considered addictive; reports of physical and psychological dependence, tolerance, and physical withdrawal symptoms are prevalent, though not universal, in experience reports. Taking kratom daily can result in physical dependence. In such instances, symptoms similar to those of opioid withdrawal usually begin 18-24 hours after the last dose and continue for 1-14 days.
Vomiting while Sedated Mixing kratom with alcohol or other sedating drugs could result in life-threatening situations related to aspiration of vomit and asphyxia if unattended.
Respiratory Depression?  When asked whether kratom was dangerous, leading medical toxicologist Edward Boyer replied:  People are afraid of opioid analgesics because they can lead to respiratory depression [difficulty breathing]. When you overdose on these drugs, your respiratory rate drops to zero. In animal studies where rats were given mitragynine, those rats had no respiratory depression. This opens the possibility of someday developing a pain medication as effective as morphine but without the risk of accidentally overdosing and dying. - Boyer E (professor of emergency medicine and director of medical toxicology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.)3
benefits :: Medical Uses. The primary medical uses described by users of kratom are analgesia (pain relief), cessation of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and sedation.
Reduction or Cessation of Opioid Withdrawal Symptoms Kratom is widely used by opioid addicts to stop or reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms. In some cases, kratom use helps individuals stop taking opioids entirely, but in other cases kratom simply replaces the other opioid addiction with daily kratom use.

[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Mitragyna speciosa
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
SCHEDULE	Un-Scheduled
federalLawText :: Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is uncontrolled in the United States. This means all parts of the plant and its extracts are legal to cultivate, buy, possess, and distribute (sell, trade or give) without a license or prescription. If sold as a supplement, sales must conform to U.S. supplement laws. If sold for consumption as a food or drug, sales are regulated by the FDA.	
In January 2016, The FDA authorized US federal marshals to seize 90,000 bottles of supplements marked as containing kratom. See http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm480344.htm?source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery.	
In Feburary 2014, the FDA issued "Import Alert 54-15" that seems to provide customs and border agents broad authority to seize kratom products from a number of suppliers outside the US. As of May 2014, it is unknown whether this import alert has substantially altered the import of raw kratom or if only some specific products can no longer be imported as completed products. See http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_1137.html	
One visitor reports that they had kratom seized by customs when shipped from outside the United States to their home in the US. (unconfirmed) (last updated Jun 23 2013)
stateLaw :: Indiana	Indiana banned the chemicals Mirtagynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine in 2012, but the legal definition does not explicitly include the raw plant kratom. It is possible that the living plant and likely that dried kratom could be considered illegal containers of these chemicals. See http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2012/HE/HE1196.1.html. Some vendors are choosing not to ship kratom to Indiana and consider this a ban of the plant material as well. (thanks k) (last updated Apr 25, 2013)
Louisiana	Louisiana banned the sale of Mitragyna speciosa to minors as of May 31, 2012. See http://legiscan.com/LA/text/SB130/id/651753. (thanks ip) (last updated Apr 25 2013)
Tennessee	Tennessee made the chemicals mitragynine and hydroxymitragynine Schedule I, making them illegal to possess. The law does not specify whether the plant Kratom is illegal, putting the plant in a legal gray area. Once extracted and prepared for human consumption, plant extracts are likely illegal in TN. "Tennesse Code Annotated, Section 39-17-452(a)(2) is amened by adding the following language as new, appropriately designated subdivisions: Mitragynine and hydroxymitragynine." See TN Code 39-17-452(a)(2). (thanks gf, jj) (last updated Oct 27, 2013)
Vermont	Vermont banned 7-hydroxymitragynine and it is assumed that this could make the plant and kratom products illegal. See http://healthvermont.gov/hc/med_board/documents/MinutesBoard12052012.pdf. (last updated Dec 14, 2015)
Wisconsin	Wisconsin classified mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I Controlled Substances, making them illegal to possess, sell, or distribute without a license. We have not seen a clear ban of the plant itself. See https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/related/acts/351#. (thanks ds) (last updated Dec 14 2015)
internationalLaw :: Austria	We received a report in 2006 telling us kratom is legal in Austria. (unconfirmed) (thanks I)
Australia	Both Mitragynine, one of the active chemicals in Kratom, and M. speciosa the plant were placed in Schedule 9 of the Australian SUSDP. See Mitragyning Scheduling and M. speciosa Scheduling.
