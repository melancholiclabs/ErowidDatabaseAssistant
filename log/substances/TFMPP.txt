TFMPP
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
SCHEDULE	Un-Scheduled
federalLawText :: Update: On March 18, 2004, TFMPP's emergency scheduling was *removed*. According to the DEA's Federal Register entry:	

"... under recommendation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a scientific evaluation of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the DHHS did not recommend control of TFMPP. Accordingly, TFMPP will no longer be controlled under the CSA after March 19, 2004."	

Previous Status: On July 18th, 2002, the DEA announced its intent to schedule BZP & TFMPP. On September 20, after two months, they issued their final order to temporarily place both BZP and TFMPP in Schedule I. The temporary scheduling will last up to 18 months or until they permanently schedule the substance. See the DEA's final order to emergency schedule for more details.

internationalLaw :: Australia	TFMPP is controlled nationally in Australia and is also specifically listed in most Australian states. The Australian National SUSDP's rulings are automatically added to each state's laws, thus TFMPP is controlled in every Australian state. Although the state-by-state listings of chemicals is mostly a point of trivia and not very important to the legal situation, it appears that BZP and TFMPP are scheduled in the highest drug restriction schedule in Vic, NSW, SA, NT and Qld.
