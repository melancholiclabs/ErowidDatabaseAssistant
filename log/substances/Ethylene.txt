description :: Ethylene is a slightly sweet-smelling hydrocarbon gas with industrial, agricultural and medical uses. Its use as an anaesthetic was discontinued in the early 1970s. A theory that ethylene inhalation may have played a role in divinatory ceremonies at Delphi in Classical Greece received popular press attention in the early 2000s, yet has not been conclusively proven.
