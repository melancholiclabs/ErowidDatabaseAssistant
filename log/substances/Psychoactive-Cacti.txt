[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Mescaline-containing Cacti
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Ambiguous
SCHEDULE	ContainsSchedule I Chemical
CLASSIFICATION	Hallucinogen
federalLawText :: San Pedro and the other columnar mescaline-containing cacti are not specifically scheduled, but they contain the controlled substance mescaline. Mescaline is a Schedule I substance in the U.S. Because of their ubiquitous availability through nurseries and major plant vendors across the country, as well as in arboretums and on government property, simple possession of columnar mescaline-containing cacti with no intent to ingest is de facto legal.	
Sellers (or anyone) who represent the cactus as a source of mescaline or sell them for their psychoactive properties (for "getting high") are at far higher risk of prosecution. Any preparation of the cactus for ingestion would likely turn the plant into a clearly scheduled (illegal) material. We are not aware of any convictions for the possession or sale of non-peyote mescaline-containing cacti such as San Pedro, but this does not mean that the cacti are "legal", it just means that the cactus has not been considered a problem and is currently not treated as a controlled plant by the police. We have been told of one prosecution (and subsequent guilty plea) for sale of powdered mescaline-containing cactus material.	


For more information, see Discussion of the US Legal Status of Non-Peyote Mescaline-Containing Cacti.
stateLaw :: Illinois	One man who sold powdered columnar cacti in Illinois was prosecuted after police found multiple kilograms of dried and powdered mescaline-containing cactus. The police went to his home after a noise complaint for a neighbor. He eventually plead guilty to felony possession of a controlled substance and was sentenced to 2.5 years, despite dried cactus being sold on ebay and other sites at the time. (thanks m) (last updated Oct 16, 2013)
South Dakota	One visitor commented:
One visitor commented:  	"I have a friend who had his residence searched; the police siezed around 30g of dried Peruvian Torch cactus flesh, 4oz of dried Amanita muscaria mushrooms, and a very small amount of cannabis seeds and stems. He was charged with possession of a controlled substance (a class 4 felony in South Dakota) because the cacti contained a scheduled substance (mescaline). He gave no information to the police with regard to ingesting the cacti or mushrooms. [...] Apparently, the prosecutors and the judge found that posession of dried cacti flesh (in combination with posession of other "drugs") is a viable means of prosecuting somebody for posession of a controlled substance." (unconfirmed) (thanks K)
Brazil	We are told that although mescaline and peyote are illegal in Brazil, Peruvian Torch and San Pedro are not. (unconfirmed) (thanks JAB)
Canada	It appears that possession and sales of San Pedro and related cacti are not prosecuted in Canada. If they are dried or otherwise prepared for use, they would likely be considered mescaline-containers and would be prosecuted under
It appears that possession and sales of San Pedro and related cacti are not prosecuted in Canada.  If they are dried or otherwise prepared for use, they would likely be considered mescaline-containers and would be prosecuted under	the 2001 Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (which replaced the older Narcotics Control Act) in which mescaline is listed as a schedule III drug. Please see Peyote Law, Canada for more information. (thanks DSK)
Germany	We are told it is legal to possess a living mescaline-containing cacti, but that intent to process into a psychoactive preparation is illegal. (unconfirmed) (thanks BT)
Ireland	While mescaline is scheduled in Ireland (see Mescaline Law Vault), we are told that fresh and dried mescaline-containing cacti are sold openly and that dried San Pedro is sold in headshops. There have reportedly been raids but no successful prosecutions, just confiscation. (Nov 2007) (unconfirmed) (thanks S, A)
Switzerland	San Pedro and Peruvian Torch cacti are listed as prohibited substances in Switzerland. (see Liste des stup&eacute;fiants prohib&eacute;s, thanks V)
United Kingdom	A 2007 court case in the U.K. resulted in a decision that left dried mescaline-containing cacti legal to sell and possess. The case (see Regina v. Saul Sette) was thrown out by the judge on the grounds that the law did not clearly make dried chips or powder illegal. This certainly indicates that fresh growing cacti are also not controlled at this time. Note that peyote is also not controlled in the United Kingdom. (last updated Jun 2007)
