[Basics]
description :: Ketamine is a dissociative anaesthetic, developed in the mid 1960's, used primarily for veterinary anaesthesiology. Although Ketamine is not used medically on humans much because it induces psychedelic episodes in patients, it is still used for some limited human applications because it does not depress breathing or circulation.   Ketamine is used recreationally primarily as a snorted white powder and for therapeutic and psychedelic use it is often injected intra-muscularly (IM). Its effects range (at lower doses) from mild inebriation, dreamy thinking, stumbling, clumsy, or 'robotic' movement, delayed or reduced sensations, vertigo, sometimes erotic feelings, increased sociability, and an interesting sense of seeing the world differently to (at higher doses) extreme difficulty moving, nausea, complete dissociation, entering complete other realities, classic Near Death Experiences (NDEs), compelling visions, black outs, etc. Ketamine is also known for being more psychologically addictive / compelling than most psychedelics and it is not uncommon to hear of users who take it once or more daily. [ Main Ketamine Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	Depending on the concentration, form, and method of administration, recreational doses of ketamine range from 30 - 300 mg. The dosage range for insufflated (snorted) ketamine varies widely from about 15-200 mg. With doses higher than about 50 mg it is advisable to be lying down. I.M. (intra-muscular injections) ketamine dosages are generally between 25-125 mg. Oral use usually requires more material, ranging from 75-300 mg.
price	sold for $50-150 USD per gram at parties & events, sold for $20-50 USD per gram for larger purchases, wholesale, or among friends.
law	Ketamine is illegal to possess in the United States without a prescription or license. It was made a schedule III substance in August, 1999. Prior to that time sales were regulated by the FDA but possession was legal. Ketamine is controlled in many countries.<
chemistry	Ketamine hydrochloride is a synthetic chemical in the 'dissociative anaesthetic' class.
pharmacology	Pharmacology Summary Needed.
production	Production Summary Needed.
history	Ketamine was first synthesized in 1962 by Calvin Stevens at Parke Davis Labs while searching for PCP anaesthetic replacements. He named it "CI581". In 1965 Ketamine was discovered to be a useful anaesthetic and was first used recreationally by Edward Domino who coined the term "dissociative anaesthetic". Ketamine was used for anaesthesia because it suppresses breathing much less than most other available anaesthetics, but in the 1970's patients began to report unwanted visions while under its influence. In 1978, John Lilly published his book "The Scientist" and Ketamine popularity grew through the 1980s until in 1995 the DEA added Ketamine to its "emerging drugs list". In 1998 & 1999, Ketamine was lumped by media and legislators with GHB as a 'date rape drug' and a 'club drug' and was emergency scheduled by the DEA on August 12, 1999.
terminology	Brand Names:Ketaset; Ketalar. The Substance:Ketamine; K; Special K; Vitamin K; Lady K. The Experience:Tripping; K-ing; The K-hole
effects :: The full ketamine experience is somewhat different than many of the psychedelics because of its nature as a dissociative. At high enough doses, users find themselves completely removed from their surroundings and disconnected from their body and sensations. Descriptions of the experience vary, but many describe alternate planes of existence, fully enveloping meetings and conversations with non-existant people or beings, and life-revelations.
effectsSections :: onset	I.M. (intra-muscular injection) Ketamine generally takes 1-5 minutes to take effect. Snorted ketamine takes a little longer at 5-15 minutes. Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, oral ketamine can take between 5 and 30 minutes to take effect.
duration	The primary effects of ketamine last approximately an 30-45 minutes if injected, 45-60 minutes when snorted, and 1-2 hours if used orally.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: Negative physical effects can include dry mouth, respiratory problems and nervousness/racing heart. Many people also experience nausea and/or vomiting on ketamine, which can obviously be a problem when taking an anaesthetics or sedatives. Supervision of higher dose ketamine experiences by a sober sitter can help ensure that an unconscious participant doesn't have problems with vomiting and/or breathing.  Two psychological difficulties which seem to come up for those who use ketamine regularly are paranoia and egocentrism. There are many reports of regular users starting to see patterns and coincidences (synchronicities) in the world around them which seem to indicate that they are somehow more important or integral to the world than others. This same sense of the world focusing on the user can also feed into a sense of paranoia.  Irritation to the bladder and urinary tract from heavy use of ketamine may occur. There is increasing evidence that frequent ketamine use (even under medical supervision using pharmaceutical ketamine) can cause short or long term pain, difficulty urinating, and other related problems.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Do not operate heavy machinery. Do not drive. Do not swim. Avoid bodies of water - At least two deaths has been recorded where an individual took a bath after using ketamine, and drowned.
addiction	Ketamine has the potential to be psychologically addicting. Some individuals who use it regularly find it difficult to stop or control their own use.
long	Long Term Health Problems Summary Needed.
death	Risk of Death Summary Needed.

description :: The effects of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine are generally reported to be pleasant, though if they are unexpectedly intense, they can be distressing. A well-known effect of ketamine at higher-range doses is the "K-hole", where the user is removed from reality and set adrift in an introspective dream-like world, often involving complete dissociation, immersive visuals and out-of-body experiences. At higher doses, the user can be incapacitated and unresponsive, or uncoordinated and erratic, appearing unwell to the uninitiated eye. Nausea and vomiting may also be present.		While ketamine is not known to be physically addictive, prolonged use could be tolerance-building as well as leading to psychological dependency.
experienceReports :: [insufflated, repeated] "[...] it was like I was pushed back a bit out of reality, making everything feel distant and even slightly unreal, typical dissociation. Everything seemed to be in a different angle, including myself. Also a certain unique visual distortion was noted, some grain and especially in the dark things seem to pull / slide in certain directions while never actually truly leaving their place. I often also physically feel this pulling and sliding too, especially if dosage increases, eventually if the dosage is high enough I will slide out of reality entirely, but this time the dose wasn't high enough for that so I would just feel like I floated around a bit, feeling unattached from my body the world and even certain parts of the mind." -- Exp 89492

doseText :: Ketamine Hydrochloride is most commonly used as a veterinary anaesthetic. It is generally injected intramuscularly, but can also be taken orally, rectally, or snorted. Much of the ketamine used recreationally is diverted from legitimate pharmaceutical sources in liquid form. Powdered ketamine is usually the result of drying liquid ketamine.  Food should not be consumed within an hour and one-half before ketamine use, and should be avoided for longer periods of time if possible as nausea and vomiting are not uncommon. As always, it should be noted that dosages and reactions vary greatly depending on the individual. Following are charts showing approximate ketamine dosages in mg (by administration type).   Nasal / Insufflated Oral Rectal Intra-Muscular         Insufflated / Nasal Ketamine Dosages &nbsp;by body weightapprox total Threshold.1 mg / lb10 - 15 mg Light.15 mg / lb15 - 30 mg Common.3 mg / lb30 - 75 mg Strong.5 - .75 mg / lb60 - 125 mg The K Hole1 mg / lb100 - 250 mg    Onset : 5 - 15 minutes Duration : 45 - 60 minutes Normal After Effects : 1 - 3 hours    Powder for nasal use are produced by gentle boiling off of solution. Nasal doses are highly unlinear next to oral and IM doses. The effects are quite different at low doses. A low dose nasally will be short and much different from a comparable oral dose.  One method described with nasal use is to insufflate (snort) 25 mg in each nostril, wait 5 minutes and repeat until desired dosage is reached.  Ketamine is often used in 'bumps' or small amounts of the powder insufflated from either a specialized micro-spoon, a specialized 'bullet', or eyeballed small piles. Bumps from bullets are commonly 30-50 mg, although their size varies by size of spoon, make of bullet, and individual. Users should be extremely careful when using a new method of sizing bumps.  Ketamine dissolved in saline solution (usually at 10% concentration) is also used intranasally. Although it is occasionally prescribed medically in the United States as an adjunct to other pain management strategies, there is no FDA-approved ketamine nasal spray product and it must be produced by a compounding pharmacy for prescription use.         Oral Ketamine Dosages &nbsp;by body weightapprox total Threshold.3 mg / lb40 - 50 mg Light.6 mg / lb50 - 100 mg Common.75 - 2 mg / lb75 - 300 mg Strong1.5 - 2.5 mg / lb200 - 450 mg The K Hole3 - 4 mg / lb500 + mg    Onset : 5 - 20 minutes (depending on stomach contents) Duration : 90 minutes Normal After Effects : 4 - 8 hours   Oral doses are prepared from a powder by placing the powder in a cup and pouring about 1 cm of hot water (tap should be ok) in it and stiring to solution. The remainder of the cup is filled with an acid such as orange juice. Ketamine itself tastes quite bad.        Rectal Ketamine Dosages &nbsp;by body weightapprox total Threshold.3 mg / lb40 - 50 mg Light.6 mg / lb50 - 100 mg Common.75 - 2 mg / lb75 - 300 mg Strong1.5 - 2.5 mg / lb200 - 450 mg The K Hole3 - 4 mg / lb500 + mg    Onset : 5 - 20 minutes Peak : 30 - 60 minutes Duration : 1 - 2 hours Normal After Effects : 1 - 4 hours   Some who choose the rectal administration route use a syringe with the needle removed. The desired dosage can be put in the syringe, inserted (using lubricant) and injected. Rectal use is similar to oral in that it has a lower peak, but longer duration.        I.M. Ketamine Dosages &nbsp;by body weightapprox total Threshold.1 mg / lb10 - 15 mg Light.15 mg / lb15 - 30 mg Common.2 mg / lb25 - 50 mg Strong.5 mg / lb40 - 100 mg The K Hole.75 mg / lb60 - 125 mg Anaesthetic1 mg / lb100 - 200 mg    Onset : 1 - 5 minutes (depending on dose and injection location) Duration : 30 - 60 minutes Normal After Effects : 2 - 4 hours   It is common to have muscle pain when injecting larger doses of liquid Ketamine into muscle tissue. The pain can continue for several days if it is not administered properly. The muscle soreness can be somewhat controlled by using a very fine (around 22 gauge) needle and by injecting very slowly. It should take 15-30 or more seconds to inject a dose into a muscle. If you feel it begin to sting, slow down the injection rate.
