description :: Methoxetamine is a near chemical analog of ketamine and PCP. Its use was first publicly reported in 2010. Methoxetamine's effects are described by some as similar to ketamine or high-dose DXM, while others report not finding it similar to those substances. A number of accounts describe compulsive redosing and unintentional consumption of more than was initially planned.

negativeEffects :: Risk of psychological dependency	Nasal discomfort upon insufflation	Blacking out and forgetting one has taken a drug	Discomfort, pain or numbness at injection site (with IM)	Severe confusion, disorganised thinking	Vertigo, spinning sensation	Nausea, vomiting	Frightening or untimely distortion or loss of sensory perception	Susceptibility to accidents (from uncoordination and change in perception of body and time)	Severe dissociation, depersonalisation	Loss of consciousness	Depression of heart rate and respiration (risk increases with increased dose or when combined with depressants)
description :: General Effects Notes	The effects of methoxetamine are usually compared to ketamine or tiletamine, but there are too few experience reports with reliably sourced material to say much with confidence. Only a few reports of individuals taking a single measured dose of verified methoxetamine by itself are available.	
Addiction and Compulsive Use	It is not yet known how addictive or likely methoxetamine is to cause compulsive use. Many reports describe it as "more-ish", indicating it might induce compulsive re-dosing in some users. Because its use is so new and uncommon, no definitive statements about it can yet be made.
experienceReports :: [50 mg insufflated, repeated] "[...] over the next hour I started drifting a bit, some mild dissociation, kinda like K but different, warm opiate effects becoming quite pronounced. [...] A lot like K but really quite different at the same time. [...] At some point after that second line, the Mrs decided (knowing what I'm like) to hide the rest of the bag from me so I didn't keep sniffing it, which for what its worth was a good call on her part but did mean that I spent most of the next hour looking for it and repeatedly asking her where it was and if it was safe." -- Exp 88687[insufflated, repeated] "After about 15 minutes or so, I felt incredibly warm, fuzzy, and somewhat disconnected from my body. I had never done dissociatives except for DXM, so for me this was a new feeling. I laid in my bed relaxing and listening to ambient music, watching images in my head of early Sociologial Theorists doing comical acts. As the initial rush/experience wore off, I noticed I could walk around my room but I was robot-like. All my actions were first calculated and thought of in my head, and no unnecessary actions were made. I thought that this must be what it is like to be an android. My field of vision was very bright, and intense, the colors were very vibrant and it was hard to focus on any one thing. Its what I eventually started to call MXE Vision." -- Exp 89488[10mg + 40mg insufflated] "During peak, I was not able to think clearly, an effect similar to a lot of alcohol or Kratom. Body felt light, but not comfortable. [...] Thoughts were disintegrated, I lost sense of space and laid down on the floor, waiting for it to happen. I listened to music (I tried to play, which was very difficult), but I did not find it enjoyable or interesting at all. [...] To me, it was much different than Ketamine, sort of pushing all the buttons, having something from opiates, from ket and from alcohol, which is something I do not prefer. I like clear mind that allows me to explore, not a state where I can hardly enjoy hallucinations and take something from it. For me, it was just wasted time. Not enjoyable, though not 'bad' per-se. I did not feel depressed, sad or very nauseated. Just in a place not rewarding in any way." -- Exp 90235[26mg + 16mg insufflated] "The time was at about 2.30 at this point and I was becoming aware that I was entering into a distinctly psychedelic, hallucinogenic experience." -- Exp 89972[repeated, insufflated] "This stuff isn't like ketamine in the sense that, with ketamine, I can return to near normality within half hour to an hour. I was ruined for about 24 hours. I had extremely intense closed eye visuals for the whole time, was unable to sleep for the best part of 2 days. Walking was possible but after lying down for a while my balance was destroyed. Speech still slurred. A complete lack of understand of words/numbers/equations etc. anything that was remotely lingual was virtually impossibly to comprehend. " -- Exp 90919

[Dose]
doseTable :: Methoxetamine Dosages
Insufflated / Nasal
( very tentative )
Threshold	5 - 20 mg
Light	10 - 50 mg
Common	20  - 60 mg
Strong	25 - 100+ mg
doseText :: Doses reported by different users vary by a large amount, with some users reporting very strong effects from 50mg insufflated (heavy motor impairment, out of body experiences, etc), while others report 50mg insufflated causes much lighter effects (able to walk around mostly unimpaired, able to carry on lucid conversations, etc).  Many users find themselves taking two or more doses in a session/day.  Methoxetamine is a dissociative ketamine analog. It is most often found in powder form that is taken nasally, orally, injected intramuscalarly (IM), or used sublingually/buccaly. We have received two descriptions that sublingual is more potent than insufflated/intranasal, which is unusual for a drug, so we have updated the dosages to increase insufflated dosages, but this is all very tentative.  A number of reports indicate that oral dosages are similar to insufflated and buccal. Oral dosages for most drugs are normally higher (requiring more material to achieve the same effect), so this is an unusual result that will need to be confirmed over time and a larger number of uses.
notes :: Some reports for methoxetamine may actually describe the ingestion of other substances that have been misrepresented as methoxetamine, complicating its profile.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
