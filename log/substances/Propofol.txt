[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Propofol
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Prescription Only
SCHEDULE	Un-Scheduled
federalLawText :: Propofol (Diprivan) is unscheduled in the United States, but is available by prescription only. This means that sales and distribution are allowed only by those with a license and only to those with a prescription (according to FDA regulations). Possession is not illegal even without a prescription.	
In October 2010, the DEA proposed adding Propofol to Schedule IV, which would make it illegal to possess without a prescription. See http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-27193.pdf. Public comments on this change are being accepted until Dec 27, 2010. Send communications to: Enforcement Administration, Attention: DEA Federal Register Representative/ODL, 8701 Morrissette Drive, Springfield, Virginia 22152.	
A July 23, 2009 proposed ruling by the DEA Office of Diversion Control recommended placing fospropofol&mdash;a prodrug of propofol that metabolizes into propofol&mdash;into schedule IV, based on a recommendation from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and on an evaluation of the relevant data by DEA (from Federal Register: July 23, 2009).
