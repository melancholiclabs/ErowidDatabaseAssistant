[Basics]
description :: Flunitrazepam is marketed as "Rohypnol" by Hoffman - La Roche in Latin America and Europe. It is sold as a treatment for insomnia as well as pre-anaesthetic medication. One of its primary actions is to cause anterograde amnesia, as well as general feelings of intoxication. It is used by some in the rave scene as a recreational psychoactive. While it is perhaps best known as a 'date rape drug' due to its use by a small number of people to facilitate date rape, this use is relatively rare. [ Main Flunitrazepam Vault ]

price	Rohypnol is available on the black market for as little as $4-5 per tablet and as high as $15 per tablet.
