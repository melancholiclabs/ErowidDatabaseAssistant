[Dose]
doseTable :: null
doseText :: Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis) contains caffeine, theobromine, and several other xanthines. The dried leaves of the plant contain approximately 1-2% caffeine. Practically this means a caffeine content of .7-1.8% of the dry tea weight becomes accessible in tea form. A single cup of mate beverage made with 10 g of dried yerba mat� tea contains approximately 70-180 mg of caffeine (similar to a cup of coffee). One heaping Tbsp of dried mat� weighs approximately 2 grams.  Mat� beverages made using tea bags have been found to contain less caffeine per weight of dried yerba mat� material than tea made using loose ground yerba mat� (.3% compared to 1-1.5%).1 A single cup of mate beverage made using a 3 g tea bag contains approximately 10-24 mg caffeine.
