[Basics]
description :: Salvia divinorum is a soft-leaved green plant, native to Southern Mexico, which contains a powerful psychoactive chemical known as Salvinorin. S. divinorum has been used traditionally in Mexico for healing and divination and became available in the underground psychedelic culture around the world starting in the early 1990's. S. divinorum is also known as "la pastora" / "the shepherdess", "the leaves of the shepherdess", "diviner's mint" or "diviner's sage", and in context simply as "Salvia". There are many species and varieties within the genus 'Salvia' and plants commonly found in garden stores are almost certainly not S. divinorum unless specifically labeled as such.  Strong effects can be difficult to attain from smoking dried leaf, but extracts and potency-bred leaves can cause dramatic, sometimes frightening, and completely enfolding entheogenic mind-states. Many people who try S. divinorum do not find the effects at all pleasant and choose not to repeat the experience. Salvia divinorum is traditionally used by chewing pairs of leaves. Modern use includes both smoking and chewing the leaves. When the leaves are chewed, the quid and bitter juice are held in the mouth to increase absorption. [ Main Salvia divinorum Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	Many people find it difficult to achieve full effects by smoking dried Salvia divinorum leaves. Those who are successful generally require multiple large hits off a pipe or bong. Typical smoked doses with plain leaf are between 0.2 to 0.5 gram, about one large, dried leaf. For sublingual consumption, a typical dosage range is 10-50 grams of fresh (wet) leaf, approximately equal to 6 to 30 leaves, or 2-10 grams of dried leaf, usually reconstituted before consumption.  Salvia divinorum extracts generally come in 5x, 6x and 10x concentrations. Dramatically less material is required the more concentrated the extract is (10x is more concentrated than 5x). A single hit of extract may be more than enough at any of these concentrations.
price	Rarely sold at parties. Dried leaf is sold for 50-100 USD per ounce. Extracts are sold for 20-50$ per gram. Live plants prices vary based on age, size, and health of plant.
law	Salvia divinorum is federally unscheduled in the United States meaning it is legal to possess and sell. The federal Analog Act generally requires chemicals be chemically similar to another scheduled substance to qualify. As salvinorin-A and salvinorin-B (the primary active chemicals in Salvia divinorum) are chemically very different from any scheduled substance, they are unlikely to be targeted under that act. Since mid-2005, Salvia divinorum has been made illegal to possess in several U.S. states (DE, FL, IL, KS, MS, MO, ND, OK) as well as a number of countries (Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, S. Korea, Sweden).
chemistry	Salvinorin A and Salvinorin B are naturally occurring chemicals which are not structurally similar to any other common psychoactives.
pharmacology	Works on the Kappa-Opioid receptor system.
production	Production Summary Needed.
history	Salvia Divinorum was first recorded in Western literature in 1939 by Jean Basset Johnston while studying psilocybin mushroom use in Mexico among the Mazatecs. R. Gordon Wasson continued to document its use between 1951 and 1962 and confirmed its psychoactivity on himself. The use of Salvia Divinorum likely dates back far into early Central American history, but documentation is so far very slim. Salvia divinorum remained an obscure entheogen until the mid 1990s when Daniel Siebert and others began self experimentation and sales of the leaf began over the net.
terminology	The Substance:Salvia divinorum; Salvia; La Pastora; Yerba Maria; The Shepherdess; Diviner's Mint; Diviner's Sage. The Experience:No common terms known.
effects :: Depending on dosage, the Salvia divinorum experience can vary from a subtle, just-off-baseline state to a full-blown psychedelic experience. At higher doses users report dramatic time distortion, vivid imagery, encounters with beings, travel to other places, planets or times, living years as the paint on a wall or experiencing the full life of another individual. Needless to say these can be extremely powerful experiences and should only be attempted with a sitter. While most people remain unmoving during the experience, some individuals will attempt to get up and walk around while in a completely dissociated state.  While sub-threshold effects are somewhat innocuous--leading some people to be cavalier in subsequent experiences--once full effects are achieved, many people find S. divinorum to be unpleasantly overwhelming and more scary than fun. As has been found with pharmaceutical kappa-opioid agonists, Salvia divinorum is aversive for many who try it.
effectsSections :: onset	When smoked, the effects of Salvia divinorum generally come on very quickly. First effects are noticed between 20-60 seconds after smoking, increasing to peak effects within 1-2 minutes.
duration	The primary effects of Salvia divinorum last between 5-15 minutes. There is then a comedown period of 20-40 minutes before returning to baseline.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: As with many smoked substances, some Salvia divinorum users report throat and lung irritation after use. Some people also experience headaches and mild irritability following use.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Use a Sitter. Some percentage of users will attempt to stand up and move around during the Salvia divinorum experience. Having a sitter present can reduce the chances of injury or other problems. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychoactives such as Salvia divinorum as it is possible that could possibly trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because strong psychoactives have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
addiction	Salvia divinorum is not known to be either physically addicting or likely to cause psychological dependence. Withdrawal effects following discontinuation have not been reported. As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There appears to be no tolerance with Salvinorin-A, so an experience can be extended or amplified by smoking more.

[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Salvia divinorum
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
SCHEDULE	Un-Scheduled
federalLawText :: Salvia divinorum is uncontrolled in the United States by federal law, but is controlled in some states (see state law). This means all parts of the plant and its extracts are legal to cultivate, buy, possess, and distribute (sell, trade or give) without a license or prescription. If sold as a supplement, sales must conform to U.S. supplement laws. If sold for consumption as a food or drug, sales are regulated by the FDA.	
The federal analog act generally requires that, in order to qualify as an analog, a substance must be chemically similar to a substance which is federally scheduled. Salvinorin A is chemically quite different from other scheduled substances and Salvia divinorum, as a plant, is quite unlikely to be targeted by this act.	
Selling Salvia divinorum for human consumption as a "drug" is probably illegal in the US under the Food, Drug & Cosmetics	Act and its sale as a drug would be regulated by the FDA. Selling an unapproved drug in the US can be prosecuted under the FD&C's "misbranding" clause. (FD&C Section 502) The more it is packaged and marketed as a drug (for example a 10x extract hyped as 'the new ecstasy') the more likely it is to be treated as an "illegal drug" by law enforcement agents.	
The US Air Force is considering whether to include Salvia divinorum in the list of banned drugs. See Plant could get airmen in legal hot water, Jan 2004.	
Update (June 2007): Between November 2006 and May 15, 2007, legislation was introduced to ban possession or sale of Salvia divinorum in fourteen additional states. See Salvia divinorum Law Update	
Update (July 2007): Daniel Siebert reports that the DEA has initiated an Eight Factor Analysis of S. divinorum, which is the first step in the process of recommending a substance be scheduled (See Sage Wisdom Legal) although other sources say this is not the case.	
US Federal Analogue Act	Under the Federal Analogue Act, Salvia divinorum fails to meet the "chemically similar" criteria and thus is not subject to the analogue act provisions. However, the DEA has recently changed their view on this and now states:	

"Salvia divinorum, Salvinorin A, and Divinorin A are not listed in the Controlled Substances Act. If sold for human consumption, S. divinorum may be subject to control under the Analogue statutes because of its functional pharmacological similarities to other CI hallucinogens like THC."	-- from DEA Diversion Salvia divinorum Page - Feb 2002	

However the DEA's analysis is completely flawed. The Federal Analogue Act, as currently understood requires that a substance be "chemically similar" to a controlled substance not "pharmacologically similar" as the DEA suggests in their quote. Very little is known about the pharmacology of Salvia divinorum and there is still much unknown about the pharmacology of THC. Saying the two are 'pharmacologically similar' might satisfy the paragraph II of the Analogue Act test, but its also just wrong. Perhaps the DEA has performed human pharamcology studies on salvinorin that they are keeping secret, but most likely the authors of this article are just trying to use their position to further extend the reach of their power well beyond the scope of the law.	
Salvinorin is not a chemical analog of any scheduled substance.

See http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/acts/2009/141.pdf : 2009 Wisconsin Act 141 for Salvinorin. It is possible that prepared extracts could be considered 'containers' of Salvinorin A, though since the law does not name the plant, the live or raw plant is likely not controlled under this statute. (thanks pz) (last updated July 31, 2012)

Normal After Effects : 30-60 minutes
doseText :: Salvia divinorum is most often smoked/vaporized, but can also be used sublingually or orally (chewed and swallowed), producing effects that last longer but have a slower onset than when smoked/vaporized. Many people find it difficult to achieve full effects by smoking/vaporizing plain dried Salvia divinorum leaves. Those who are successful may require multiple large hits from a pipe or bong. Typical smoked/vaporized doses with plain leaf range from 0.2 to 0.5 grams, or about one large, dried leaf.  When consumed sublingually, a number of leaves are chewed and held (along with the saliva produced) under the tongue, without swallowing, for approximately 15-20 minutes before being spit out. Oral ingestion is the traditional Mazatec method of consumption, but as the stomach (and intestinal?) linings appear to be very poor at absorbing the active constituents, it is the least efficient method of consumption, requiring a larger number of leaves.1,2 This method is seldom employed outside traditional contexts.  The primary active constituent of Salvia divinorum is salvinorin A, which can be extracted from the plant material and re-applied to dried S. divinorum leaves to produce fortified leaf of various strengths (5X, 6X, 10X, etc.) for smoking/vaporizing. Correspondingly less material is required the more potent the extract is (10X is more potent than 5X). Salvia extracts are also sold in various types of liquids, which can be consumed sublingually; the salvinorin A slowly enters the bloodstream through absorption in the mouth. While some people only achieve a full experience using fortified leaf or extract, many people can have a full experience from a single or small number of smoked/vaporized hits of plain leaf. Care should be taken with fortified leaf and liquids, as they are much more potent than normal S. divinorum leaf and can produce an unexpectedly overwhelming experience.  The charts below show typical dosages for smoked/vaporized plain and fortified leaf, and for sublingual consumption of plain leaf.
