description :: Cannabis, a fast-growing bushy annual with dense sticky flowers, produces psychoactive cannabinoid chemicals such as THC and CBD. It is the most widely used (still mostly) illegal psychoactive and has a long history of medicinal, recreational, and industrial use. The fibrous stalks of the plant are used to produce clothing and rope. It's legal status is rapidly changing in the US and around the world from top contraband to tolerated mind-alterant along side alcohol and caffeine.

[Basics]
description :: Cannabis is a leafy plant which grows wild in many of the tropic and temperate areas of the world. It is cultivated both indoors and out for the production of its flowering tops. The most commonly used form of cannabis are the leaves and flowering tops (buds) which may be either smoked or eaten; It also comes in a more concentrated resinous form called hashish, and as a sticky black liquid called hash oil. There are three distinct species of cannabis: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis, though there is some argument as to whether these should be considered varieties rather than species. Most recreationally used cannabis is the result of interbreeding between these three types. The term 'hemp' is generally used to describe low-thc varieties of cannabis which are grown for industrial uses. [ Main Cannabis Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	The strength of cannabis varies greatly from one variety to another. Some, known as 'one-hit-shit', requires only a single lung-full to reach full effects while other varieties require many hits to achieve the same effects. Additionally, the amount that one individual likes to smoke can be many times what another prefers. Generally, 1/8 ounce (3.5 g) of mid-quality bud could get around 20-30 people reasonably high.
price	Cannabis is sold on the street for anywhere between $25 - $150 per 1/4 ounce depending on quality and location. In the U.S., prices are generally $30-$60 for 1/4 ounce of lower quality and $60-$120 for 1/4 ounce of high quality bud. Prices drop quickly as quantity goes up, with prices for one pound of the lowest quality cannabis going from 0 (leaves are sometimes given away during harvest) to $200 and good quality buds from $1200 - $2000 per pound.
law	The legal status of cannabis is currently shifting around the world. Although the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances prohibits cannabis and requires counties to prohibit its use and sale, individual US states and some countries have started legalizing cannabis. As of August 2015, Cannabis has been nationally legalized in Uruguay (2013) and Jamaica (2015). In contradiction of federal law, four American states have legalized the recreational use of cannabis; Alaska, Oregon, Colorado and Washington. Efforts to decriminalise cannabis have also been undertaken in a number of countries including Switzerland, Italy, Chile, Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Germany and the Czech Republic.  Prescription and quasi-prescription medical use of cannabis is increasingly legally recognized, with individual cities, states, and countries exploring approved medical use.
chemistry	The active ingredients in cannabis are called cannabinoids. There are many cannabinoids synthesized by the plant including tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabinol, cannabidiol, cannabinolidic acid, cannabigerol, and cannabichromene. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is thought to be responsible for most of the psychoactive effects of cannabis and is the active ingredient in synthetic thc pills such as marinol.
pharmacology	Pharmacology Summary Needed.
production	Cannabis plants do grow wild in many parts of the world, but the quality of wild specimens ('ditch-weed') is generally quite low. Most cannabis is cultivated intentionally and can be grown either indoors or out.
history	The cannabis plant has been used both medicinally and recreationally for thousands of years. It wasn't until the early 19th century that the use of cannabis as a psychoactive spread from China and the Middle East to the population of Europe and then to America in the middle of the century. Cannabis was made illegal in the U.S. in 1937 and has continued to be a popular recreational substance since that time.
terminology	The Substance:Cannabis; Marijuana; Marihuana; Pot; Dope; Weed; Grass; Bud; Ganja; Mary Jane; Doobie; Hashish; Hash; Bhang. The Experience:Stoned; High.
effects :: The primary effects sought by those using cannabis recreationally are euphoria, relaxation, and changes in perception. Effects vary depending on dosage, with effects at low doses including a sense of well-being, mild enhancement of senses (smell, taste, hearing), subtle changes in thought and expression, talkativeness, giggling, increased appreciation of music, increased appetite, and mild closed-eye visuals. At higher doses, visuals may become more prominent, sense of time is altered, attention span and memory are frequently affected, and thought processes and mental perception may be significantly altered.
effectsSections :: onset	When smoked, the effects of cannabis begin almost immediately. When eaten the effects can take 1 to 2 hours to manifest, based primarily on how much food is in the stomach.
duration	The effects of smoked cannabis peak after about 20 minutes and last for 1-2 hours. When eaten, the effects will peak more slowly and primary effects may last for 3-4 hours.
visuals	While most people do not experience a strong visual component to the cannabis experience, some do and some particular varieties of cannabis as well as higher doses are more likely to produce this effect.
problems :: Negative effects can include paranoia, dry mouth, respiratory problems and nervousness/racing heart. Other effects may be negative or inconvenient in certain settings or situations including reduced ability to concentrate, impaired memory, tiredness, and confusion. Side effects tend to increase with lifetime use: as users age, they often report the anxiety-producing and uncomfortable effects increase and the euphoria decreases.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Avoid Driving - While there has been little formal study into the effects of cannabis on driving, it is generally a good idea to avoid driving while under the influence of any psychoactive or intoxicating substance. Several studies have shown that drivers who use alcohol and cannabis in combination are far less capable than when taking either substance alone. Some studies have shown that cannabis causes impairment in driving performance, but that users often are aware of the impairment and compensate by driving more carefully.
addiction	Regular use of cannabis can lead to psychological habituation for some people making it difficult for them to quit. Studies have estimated that between 5 and 10% of those who try smoking cannabis will become daily users sometime during their life, but most of these smokers will have given up the habit by age 30 and few remain daily smokers after age 40. Most people do not experience signs of physical addiction, but with regular daily use use, mild to medium withdrawal symptoms usually occur for less than a week, but can extend for as long as 6 weeks.
long	The most common negative health impact of regular cannabis smoking are lung and throat problems including: coughing, increased frequency of throat and lung infections, and reduced lung capacity. There are concerns about possible long term carcinogenic (cancer causing) effects of cannabis smoking, but the results are still somewhat controversial. It can be safely said, however, that health risks increase with frequency and duration of smoking anything.
death	There are no confirmed, published death reports from cannabis-only poisoning. Especially given the wide use of cannabis, it appears that fatal reactions are approximately unheard of. There are a small number of people who report serious cannabis allergies which cause unexpectedly intense reactions, throat & lung irritation, etc.
heart	Because cannabis increases heart rate, it could potentially increase risks of heart problems in those at risk of heart disease. One study found that cannabis use increased the risk of heart attack in men over 40, but its findings were weak and based on a very small number of individuals. In a large study of 65,000 individuals in California by Sidney et al in 1997, cannabis was not found to increase mortality rates among users under 50.
mental	For those with schizophrenia, paranoia, or symptoms of psychosis, the use of cannabis, alcohol, and other recreational drugs can contribute to worsening symptoms and a decline in normal functioning. It is less clear whether cannabis causes asymptomatic--or otherwise healthy--people more than temporary paranoia and anxiety, though several major studies have documented an association between the use of cannabis by young people and later diagnosis of psychotic disorders. Those with a family history of psychotic disorders or who are otherwise predisposed to mental illness may be at increased risk of problematic mental health issues if they use cannabis.

description :: The primary effects sought by those using cannabis recreationally are euphoria, relaxation, and changes in perception. Effects vary depending on dosage, with effects at low doses including a sense of well-being, mild enhancement of senses (smell, taste, hearing), subtle changes in thought and expression, talkativeness, giggling, increased appreciation of music, increased appetite, and mild closed-eye visuals. At higher doses, sense of time is altered, attention span and memory are frequently affected, and thought processes and mental perception may be significantly altered.	
One of the most common comments about cannabis is that it enhances the appreciation of sensory experiences without substantially changing the perceptual experience. Many people attribute their love of music, appreciation for new forms of music, and ability to play instruments to the use of cannabis.	
At overly high doses, the effects are often likened to other psychedelics and panic and dysphoria (bad mood) are more common. High doses, especially when taken orally, can sometimes result in difficult experiences and trips to the emergency room in response to racing heart, extreme confusion, short-term memory loss, and panic. After high-dose experiences, especially among those who are not regular users, after effects can last 1-2 days.	
Paradoxically, although cannabis is normally considered a relaxant / depressant, its effects are stimulating in a substantial portion of those who use it. While some people use it to help them sleep, others cannot sleep for 3-6 hours after their last smoke.

[Health]
notes :: Use of cannabis is relatively safe, compared to many recreational psychoactives. There are no confirmed deaths caused by cannabis alone, although deaths can and do result from injuries sustained while intoxicated. Especially when combined with alcohol, cannabis has been shown to reduce driving ability and can contribute to traffic accidents. The primary health concerns related to cannabis use are lung and airway health (but not cancer), accidental injuries, reversible reductions in memory scores, and triggering of paranoid and psychotic thinking in vulnerable individuals.	
It is worth noting that the first large age cohort (people who were in their teens between 1967 and 1980) of heavy, frequent cannabis smokers in the United States is only now reaching the age at which many serious health complications occur.	
For many years, anti-cannabis campaigns have included the theory that the use of cannabis causally leads to use and abuse of other recreational psychoactives. This "Gateway Theory" is now considered a debunked myth, with dozens of scientific papers showing that other factors cause the correlation and cannabis use itself does not cause the use of other drugs. Even the DEA has abandoned this theory.1,2,3,4	
The political climate around cannabis and other recreational psychoactive substances makes it complicated to find balanced opinions about its safety and risks. Prohibitionist organizations and individuals are more likely to emphasize risks associated with heavy use and those who believe cannabis should be legalized focus on the much lower risks associated with occasional use.5
deaths :: Cannabis use does not, by itself, cause death. Deaths can result from accidental injuries (such as car accidents). Extreme panic reactions, especially after oral consumption of high dose cannabis, have resulted in many people being briefly hospitalized until they come down, but no deaths from anxiety reactions have been reported.
warnings :: null
cautions :: Dramatic Changes in Thinking.  Changes to thought processes, while among the primary reasons why people choose to use cannabis, can also impair judgement.
Respiratory Ailments.  Frequent smoking of cannabis can lead to respiratory ailments, including COPD, associated with smoke inhalation. The most common negative health impact of regular cannabis smoking are lung and throat problems including: coughing, increased frequency of throat and lung infections, and reduced lung capacity.  Although cannabis smokers have used bongs/water pipes to reduce the impact on their lungs, a 1995 study6 suggests that use of water pipe does not lower the overall ratio of particulate matter to THC and may be counterproductive. In other words, it lowers the particulate matter, but it also lowers the amount of THC, and may cause users to simply smoke more material. Vaporizers are reported to reduce the lung impact of 'smoking' cannabis.  A large, well-designed study of tens of thousands of hospital patients found that cannabis use does not cause cancers of the airway and lungs.7,8,9,10  In 2013, a comprehensive review of all studies on regular use of cannabis and lung health and found that although regular cannabis use was associated with airway irritation and increased bronchitis, it is not associated with with the development of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, or bullous lung disease. The author, Donald Tashkin writes:  "[H]abitual use of marijuana alone does not appear to lead to significant abnormalities in lung function [...] [F]indings from a limited number of well-designed epidemiological studies do not suggest an increased risk of either lung or upper airway cancer from light or moderate use. Overall, the risks of pulmonary complications of regular use of marijuana appear to be relatively small and far lower than those of tobacco smoking." (Tashkin 2013) 13
Short-Term Memory Impairment. Cannabis intoxication is known to cause memory impairment during the period of acute effects, but the reduced ability to store and recall memories can linger for days and affect cognitive or academic test scores.
Panic and Anxiety Attacks. Some people may experience panic attacks (including extreme feelings of dread, accelerated heart rate, feeling as if they're going to die) from smoking cannabis. [See the Psychedelic Crisis FAQ for information about such an occurrence.]
Increased Heart Rate. Cannabis use causes an increase in heart rate in many users, usually lasting for the period of intoxication and slowing back down as the cognitive effects wane.
Cannabis and Mental Health.  Cannabis use has been implicated in triggering psychosis and other mental health problems. Although these issues are complex and (as of 2015) still an active area of research, a 2011 report by the FDA in their role as US Department of Health and Human Services advisors to the DEA found no clear causal linkage between cannabis use and psychotic mental disorders.10,11,12
Cannabis and Brain Area Shrinkage  In the 2000s, a new risk was suggested by some researchers that using cannabis by teenagers could cause reductions in the volumes/sizes of certain important brain areas. These were not experimental studies, but instead used brain scans of living humans. Research published in 2015 by Weiland et al. found no differences in those brain areas in a tightly controlled study.
Cannabis Interactions.  Cannabis is not known to have negative health interactions with many other drugs, but some report unpleasant effects when combined with alcohol or venlafaxine (Effexor). See Venlafaxine Interactions.
benefits :: Medical Uses. Cannabis has many possible medical uses. Symptom relief is claimed for ailments such as cancer, AIDS wasting syndrome, and glaucoma. Patients have found that the appetite-stimulating and anti-nausea properties of cannabis can help to mitigate the drastic weight loss and weakness from wasting syndrome and the nausea of cancer chemotherapy, and help them to regain weight. Cannabis reportedly helps glaucoma patients by reducing ocular pressure, which can cause damage to the eye.  Cannabis and cannabinoids have repeatedly been found to be effective at treating chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and spacicity associated with multiple sclerosis.

legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Cannabis
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Scheduled
SCHEDULE	Schedule I
CLASSIFICATION	Hallucinogen
MOVEMENT	Likely Federally Legalized before 2020
federalLawText :: The Cannabis plant (listed as "Marihuana") and its major active chemicals including delta-9-THC (listed as "Tetrahydrocannabinols") are Schedule I in the United States. This means they are federally illegal to buy, possess, cultivate, synthesize, or distribute (sell, trade or give) in all forms (cannabis plants, extracts, hash, hash oil, THC, wax, etc.). In one of the incoherent curiosities of the current Controlled Substances Act, a specific synthetic THC (dronabinol; Marinol) is Schedule III. This means THC is both without a "currently accepted medical use" and has a fully FDA-approved medical use.	
Practically, simple possession of small amounts is almost never prosecuted federally. Arrests and punishments for cannabis-related offenses are based on state and local law. For state-by-state laws, see below.	
In 2015, the legal status of cannabis in the United States is rapidly changing towards legalization for recreational and medical use. Several states have already set up legal regulatory systems to allow for the growing and distribution of cannabis inside their borders. These remain in a legal gray area with regard to federal law, and many major U.S. politicians are now saying they will support removal of cannabis from Schedule I, allowing states to choose its legal status. Most non-idealogical expert observers believe that cannabis is well on its way to becoming fully legalized and regulated in most U.S. states in the next decade.	

History of US Cannabis Law	
The federal scheduling of Cannabis was disputed in 1988 by Judge Francis Young, an administrative law judge for the DEA, who recommended that marijuana be reclassified as schedule II on the grounds that if a respectable minority of doctors endorse it, then it has a "currently accepted medical use". Full text of Judge Young's ruling]	
Historical Laws	
Text of the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937	The history of the Marihuana Tax Act	

MEDICAL MARIJUANA	Cannabis has many reported and demonstrated medical uses. Its most active component (THC) is an approved drug in the United States and the second most active drug in the plant, Cannabidiol (CBD), is heading towards FDA approval for specific indications. Starting in 1975, after losing a court case, the US government was forced to provide a small number of people with medical cannabis based on "medical necessity". Although closed to new applicants in 1992, it is another example of the confusing question of cannabis's medical value. The US Congress has defined through legislation that it has no medical use, but that has never been fully true, and is now just a bizarre historical error encoded into law, policy, and public educational programs. As of November 2015, 23 states and Washington DC have legalized cannabis for medical use. See NORML's Medical Marijuana by State and the Congressional Research Service's Medical Marijuana: Review and Analysis of Federal and State Policies (Eddy 2010) for a review of the legal history of medical cannabis in the United States.

Alaska	In November 2014, Alaska passed a voter initiative legalizing the recreational use of cannabis for those 21 and older. The new law allows possession up to one ounce of cannabis and grow up to six plants. It creates a legal market and legalizes cannabis-related paraphernalia. See http://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Marijuana_Legalization,_Ballot_Measure_2_%282014%29. Previously, the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts had ruled that personal possession of cannabis was protected by state constitution's privacy clause. As recently as Sep 14, 2004, the AK Supreme Court refused to overturn a unanimous Appellate Court decision that police were not allowed to enter a home simply based on smelling cannabis smoke outside. See Pot vs Privacy, Oct 2003 and Alaska Supreme Court chooses privacy over pot, Sep 2004 and Eric Sterling's Response. The Alaska Legislature passed a law banning cannabis, but a judge struck down the law in July 2006: Judge rules against Alaska marijuana ban law, Jul 2006, AP. ACLU Press Release July 11, 2006 (last updated Nov 9 2015)
California	Nearly legal for any purpose with the caveat that smoking anything indoors is banned with very few exceptions. Cannabis is fully decriminalized in the state of California and, while a ticket can be issued for its use or possession, it's status as an infraction instead of a crime removes it as a justification for further searches by police.
Colorado	Recreational and medical cannabis are legal in Colorado as of early 2014 for those 21 and older. Individuals are allowed to grow plants and regulated businesses can grow and sell cannabis, its concentrates, and orally ingestible food-type preparations. Use in public is outlawed.
Delaware	Medical use of cannabis is approved, but recreational use of cannabis in Delaware is a misdemeanor crime. See http://norml.org/laws/item/delaware-penalties. (last updated Nov 1, 2015)
Florida	Recreational use of cannabis is a misdemeanor crime and no broad medical use has been approved in Florida. Florida has passed a law allowing high CBD / low THC preparations for treating epilepsy. Unlike many states, distribution / sale of under 20grams is only a misdemeanor, with lower penalties for sale than most states. See http://norml.org/laws/item/florida-penalties (last updated Nov 1, 2015)
Georgia	Recreational use of cannabis is a misdemeanor crime and no broad medical use has been approved in Georgia.

Idaho	Recreational use of cannabis is a misdemeanor crime in Idaho and no medical use is approved. Idaho's personal-possession limit is higher than most states, with up to three ounces qualifying as a misdemeanor crime. (last updated Nov 1, 2015)
Illinois	Recreational use of cannabis is a misdemeanor crime in Illinois, although medical use is approved. As of Jan 1, 2014, the medical use of cannabis became legal in Illinois. In 2013, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed a medical cannabis law, allowing the legal use, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis for specific medical purposes. The law is restrictive, limiting the number of grow sites, dispensaries, and ailments. See http://www.mpp.org/states/illinois/. For non-medical possession, The non-medical use of cannabis in Illinois is still a crime. Illinois has steep fines and harsh jail sentences, with penalties up to 30 days in jail and up to $1,500 in fines for simple possession of less than 2.5 grams, less than an eight ounce. (last updated Oct 4 2015)
Maryland	Recreational use of cannabis is decrminalized to a civil offense in Maryland and medical use is approved. Distributing cannabis has harsh penalties associated with it. (last updated Nov 1, 2015)
Massachusetts	Personal possession of less than an ounce of cannabis is decriminalized in Massachussets: it is a civil infraction, not a crime. In Nov 2008 voters overwhelmingly passed a ballot measure to deciminalize possession of up to 1 oz. of cannabis, making such offenses subject to a civil fine of $100. Minors face a $1000 fine and/or a mandatory drug awareness program. (last updated Nov 1, 2015)
Michigan	Recreational use is a crime in Michigan, but medical use is allowed. In Nov 2008 a ballot measure passed legalizing the medical use of cannabis, which removed state penalties for registered patients possessing cananbis. It will not create legal dispensaries or affect federal controls on cannabis in the state. (last updated Nov 1, 2015)
Minnesota	Recreational use of cannabis is partially decriminalized in Minnesota, although medical cannabis has been approved. Distribution of under 42.5 grams without being paid (friend to friend transactions) are misdemeanors in Minnesota. See http://norml.org/laws/item/minnesota-penalties-2. (last updated Nov 1, 2015)
Montana	Recreational use of cannabis is a crime in Montana and no medical use is allowed. In Nov 2006, a local ballot measure in Missoula County was passed that tells law enforcement to make "citations, arrests, property seizures and prosecutions for adult marijuana offenses Missoula County's lowest law enforcement priority." See Helena ir.com. Tthe police are said to be ignoring this rule and have not substantially changed how they handle simple cannabis possession cases. (thanks p) (last updated Oct 1 2015)
New Hampshire	Recreational use of cannabis is a crime in New Hampshire, though medical use has been approved. (last updated Nov 1 2015)
New Mexico	Recreational use of cannab is a crime in New Mexico, but it does allow for medical use. New Mexico has the "Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act" allowing medical use of cannabis regulated under the New Mexico Department of Health. See NMDoH: Medical Cannabis Program and Drug Policy Alliance's Page on New Mexico's Law. (last updated may 20 2015)
New York	Recreational use of cannabis is decriminalized in New York and medical use has been approved. New York decrminalized private possession of up to 25 grams of cannabis to be a civil citation punishable up to $250 + $100 court surcharge. However, posession in public (including hidden in a pocket) is a misdemeanor crime punishable by $500 and 3 months of incarceration. See http://norml.org/laws/penalties/item/new-york-penalties-2. (last updated Jul 19 2015)
North Carolina	Recreational use of cannabis is partially decriminalized in North Carolina, but has uniquely approved the medical use of high CBD, low THC products for the treatment of epilepsy. Cannabis is listed in Schedule VI, putting it out of step with US federal law. Dronabinol is Schedule II in N. Carolina. [reference] (last updated Nov 14, 2015)
Oregon	Cannabis for recreational use is legal in Oregon, and Oregon was one of the first states to permit medical use. Oregon voters passed a cannabis legalization initiative in November 2014 that would allow possession and growing of cannabis and create a legal market for sale and purchase. The law took effect on July 1, 2015. Households can have up to four live plants. See Marijuana legalization Q&A: What's next for Oregon? (The Oregonian, Nov 2014) and Oregon Legalized Marijuana Initiative, Measure 91 (2014). Curiously, the federal TSA (air travel security agency) announced that carrying up to an ounce of cannabis for in-state flight is allowed. (last updated July 15, 2015)
Pennsylvania	In April 2016, Pennsylvania law changed to permit medical production, sale, and use of cannabis. It will likely take more than a year before sales and regulations actually allow legal distribution inside Pennsylvania.

Rhode Island	Recreational use of cannabis is decriminalized in Rhode Island and it has approved medical cannabis. Rhode Island legalized the medical use of cannabis in Jan 2006, overriding a veto of the legislation by Governor Don Carcieri (house vote 59-13). The law allows people with certain illnesses such as cancer to register with the state, receive a special ID card, and then grow up to 12 plants or buy/possess up to 2.5 ounces of dried cannabis. AP story by ML Johnson, Jan 3, 2006. (last updated Oct 14 2015)
Texas	Recreational use of cannabis is a misdemeanor crime in Texas and no medical use has been approved. Texas is one of a number of states with Tax Stamps, a bizarre invention to try to interest tax revenue authorities into investigating cultivation and sale, as well as adding on additional penalties for anyone caught up in the legal system. See http://norml.org/legal/item/texas-tax-stamps. (last updated Nov 1 2015)
Virginia	Recreational use of cannabis is a misdemeanor crime in Virginia and no broad medical cannabis use is allowed. Virginia is one of several states that has approved a high CBD/low THC preparation for the treatment of epilepsy. See http://norml.org/laws/item/virginia-penalties-2. (last updated Oct 30, 2015)

Washington D.C.	Recreational use of cannabis is legalized in Washington D.C. and medical use has been approved. In November 2014, DC voters passed initiative 71, legalizing recreational use for those 21 and older. POsession of up to two ounces of cannabis, growing up to six plants, giving up to an ounce, and use of cannabis pipes and paraphernalia. The US Congress can invalidate the initiative because of strange rules regarding the governance of the DC area. See http://ballotpedia.org/Washington_D.C._Marijuana_Legalization,_Initiative_71_%28November_2014%29. (last updated Nov 9 2015)
Washington State	Recreational use of cannabis is legal in Washington state and the medical use cannabis is approved. Washington has one of the nation's first Drugged Driving rule specifying blood levels of cannabinoids. Washington State passed a voter referendum on November 6, 2012, that created a legal structure for cannabis to be produced, distributed, sold, and used recreationally. The exact rules for how this legalization will be implemented have not yet been finalized. See http://sensiblewashington.org/blog/. In December, 2012, the Seattle Police stated that they would not arrest or cite people for smoking cannabis in public for a month or so: http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2012/11/09/marijwhatnow-a-guide-to-legal-marijuana-use-in-seattle/ (last updated Nov 14 2015)

doseText :: SMOKED CANNABIS Cannabis dosage is fairly easy to manage. A good method for determining your dose is to smoke a small amount (a quarter to two "hits"), wait 5-15 minutes, repeat as desired. The strength of cannabis products increased dramatically between 2000 and 2016. When considering waxes, oils, and other high potency extracts, always start smoking a tiny hit. For sensitive people, a mouth full of smoke from a high potency oil is enough to become confusingly stoned.  A single intake of smoke from a pipe, water pipe, or joint is generally called a hit. An average size hit from a pipe or water pipe weighs somewhere on the order of 1/20th of a gram. With reasonably high potency Cannabis buds, a small number of hits (1-3) is generally enough. The lower the potency the more hits people will need to achieve the desired effects.  Below is a chart with very approximate dosages for dry, smoked, high potency cannabis. These numbers will vary greatly depending on individual reaction, potency, and smoking method. Generally, brown leafy cannabis is not as strong as green, gold, purple sticky buds. There does exist "One Hit Shit" that can surprise even the veteran smoker with it's strength. Pay attention to your body's reaction when you first try a new type or a new smoking method, and be careful when introducing others to cannabis. Everyone reacts differently to different doses.
