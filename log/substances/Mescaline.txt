[Basics]
description :: Mescaline is a psychoactive phenethylamine chemical, best known for being the primary psychoactive component in peyote and San Pedro cacti. It was first isolated by Arthur Heffter in 1897 when he was trying to identify the mind-altering principals in peyote. Mescaline is considered one of the classic psychedelic / entheogens, with a long history of traditional use in North and South America (in the form of cacti), formalized modern ritual use in the Native American Church, considered by many experienced users as uniquely powerful, and widely known througout the world because of the many accounts of its use. Both synthetic and extracted crystaline mescaline are available on the underground markets, but both are rare and usually quite expensive. [ Main Mescaline Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	A standard dose for oral mescaline use ranges from 200-500 mg. One of the more common myths around its use is that it can come in the form of tiny microdot pills. Even 200 mg of material fills a medium size capsule, so obviously microdots are not mescaline.  Mescaline concentration in cacti varies from one species to the next. Peyote is traditionally eaten in pairs of buttons, with anwhere from a single pair (2 buttons) to dozens of pairs of buttons (24 or more) being consumed over the course of an evening/night. Dosages of columnar cacti like San pedro and Peruvianus are generally measured by the number of inches of cacti consumed. One rule of thumb for a relatively potent variety is one foot of cacti (approx 4 inches in diameter) per dose, another says a piece of cacti the length from your elbow to your fingertips.
price	Pure crystaline mescaline is very rare in the underground and is usually expensive when available (40+ USD per dose). Live trichocereus range in price from 10$ per foot for the cheapest cut columns to 80$ per foot or more for rooted columns. Prepared trichocereus is almost unheard of for sale. We have no data on the current price of peyote buttons in the US. (August 2000)
law	Mescaline is illegal to possess in the United States (schedule I). It is Schedule I by United Nations Convention and is illegal to possess in most  countries. Mescaline containing cacti, however, are controlled very differently from country to country. In the U.S. peyote possession is federally illegal except for some native American ritual use, while some states allow even broader use. Canada excepts peyote from its scheduling as do some other countries. Many other species of mescaline containing cacti are uncontrolled in both the U.S. and other countries.

history	Mescaline was first isolated and identified by German chemist Arthur Heffter in 1897, but the use of mescaline cacti has been documented in North & South America for thousands of years. Immediately after European subjugation of the native populations in the Americas, Peyote and San Pedro use became persecuted by Christian zealots and the mescaline-using traditions were forced to go underground. In the late 1800s these traditions slowly began a resurgance as North American indians began incorporating peyote use into their religious practices and persecution in South America diminished. Peyote was banned federally in the United States in 1967 and was placed in Schedule I when the Controlled Substance Act was passed in 1971.

federalLawText :: Mescaline (as well as Peyote) is Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) without a DEA license.	
Mescaline-containing columnar, such as San Pedro, have a more complex legal status. Please see the Mescaline-Containing Cacti Law Vault.	
Peyote's legal status is less ambiguous, but has its own legal issues. See the Peyote Law Vault for more information.

If hydrochloric acid is used the result is mescaline hydrochloride. If sulphuric acid is used, the result is mescaline sulfate. If citric acid is used, the result is mescaline citrate. And if acetic acid (vinegar) is used, the result is mescaline acetate. Each of these forms has a different molecular weight and therefore dosage...as well as having a different level of solubility in water (the more soluble it is in water, the more mescaline will be extracted from the plant material in an aqueous extraction).  The two most commonly produced synthetic forms of mescaline are mescaline hydrochloride and mescaline sulfate which have very similar dosages. Mescaline sulfate is 11% heavier than mescaline hydrochloride, meaning it takes 11% _more_ mescaline sulfate by weight to get the same effects as a certain amount of mescaline hydrochloride.  If an acid--base--solvent extraction is done on the plant material the result is freebase mescaline. Freebase mescaline is 15% lighter than mescaline hydrochloride (and 25% lighter than mescaline sulfate), thereby requiring 15% _less_ material by weight for the same dose as mescaline hydrochloride. However, most (if not all) extractions end with the freebase being turned into a salt. If the extracted mescaline is not converted to a salt and the solvent is evaporated, it can readily form a salt with the carbon dioxide in the air, forming Mescaline carbonate (molecular weight unknown?).  More information about calculating mescaline dosages    Mescaline is found in many types of cacti, most prominently in peyote (lophophora williamsii), San Pedro (trichocerus pachanoi) and the Peruvian Torch (trichocerus peruvianus). The mescaline content of the various mescaline containing cacti varies greatly between individual samples as well as between species. Following is an estimate of the mescaline contents of these three species. Although there has long been a myth that Trichocerus peruvianus is "10 times" stronger than T. pachanoi, there is not much data to support this view. Many reports indicate that peruvianus may be somewhat stronger than pachanoi, but this is hotly disputed among cactus experts. See A Look at the Mescaline Content of T. peruvianus and T. pachanoi.   Lophophora williamsii - 300 mg / 27 g dried material Trichocerus peruvianus - 300 mg / 15 to 100 grams dried material (.3% - 2.0%) Trichocerus pachanoi - 300 mg / 15 to 100 grams grams dried material (.3% - 2.0%)   178 mg mescaline HCl = 200 mg mescaline sulfate.
