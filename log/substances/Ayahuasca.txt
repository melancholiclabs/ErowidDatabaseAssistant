description :: Ayahuasca is a powerfully psychedelic South American brew traditionally made from the B. caapi vine and admixtures such as P. viridis (and/or other DMT-containing plants). One of its primary effects is considered to be the vomiting (the purge) that accompanies the experience. The term ayahuasca is sometimes loosely used to mean any combination of an MAOI with DMT.

[Basics]
description :: "Ayahuasca" is a term for both the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and for the visionary brew made from that plant, usually in combination with an additional DMT-containing plant(s). The word "ayahuasca", from the Quechua language, means "vine of the souls". A traditional South American preparation, the ayahuasca brew frequently employs Psychotria viridis leaves as the DMT source. Inclusion of B. caapi, which contains monoamine oxidase inhibiting harmala alkaloids) allows the DMT, which would otherwise be quickly broken down in the body by the enzyme monoamine oxidase, to become orally active.  Ayahuasca is prepared by boiling or soaking its plant components; traditional brews may sometimes contain additional psychoactive and/or medicinal plants including tobacco, Brugmansia, Datura, and a long list of others.  Outside the Amazon basin, in cities around the world, ayahuasca is prepared with a wide variety of ingredients including pure chemicals (sometimes called "pharmahuasca") or substituted "analogue" plants, such as the root-bark from Mimosa tenuiflora [= M. hostilis] (sometimes called "mimosahuasca"), and often the seeds of Peganum harmala (Syrian rue) as a source of MAO-inhibiting harmala alkaloids. Ayahuasca is known for its tendency to induce vomiting and/or diarrhea in many users, its rich and complex visual effects, its reported healing properties, and its powerful mind-altering entheogenic effects.

descriptionSections :: dose	As the dosage of ayahuasca increases, the effects become stronger and more intense; at a certain point, some people may black out and forget much of the experience.
price	Ayahuasca brew is rarely available in the general underground market, but is sometimes sold or distributed within small networks of people. When available, brew made from traditional plants (B. caapi + P. viridis) has sold for around $50 per dose. Participation in underground ayahyasca circles cost $100-300 (or more) per person. Component materials are available for a wide range of prices, with analogue plants tending to cost less.
law	While none of the standard plant constituents of ayahausca are specifically controlled federally in the United States, DMT is Schedule I in the U.S. and in most countries. As a DMT-containing preparation, ayahuasca is generally considered to be illegal. Harmala alkaloids are not scheduled in the U.S., but some are Schedule III in Canada. Numerous ayahuasca plants and their analogues are illegal in France. We are not aware of any other countries in which Hamine or Harmaline are scheduled. Religious use of ayahuasca was specifically allowed by Brazil's Supreme Court in the late 1980s.
chemistry	Some South American shaman have said that the "true spirit" of ayahuasca is in the B. caapi vine, which contains the MAOI harmala alkaloids. They say that the DMT-containing plants are primarily used to give the visions more color and depth, but are not the primary force of the message. Others argue that DMT is the dominant part of the brew, as it is a far more psychoactive substance than any harmala alkaloids by themselves.
pharmacology	Pharmacology Summary Needed.
production	Production Summary Needed.
history	Harmaline was first isolated from Syrian rue seeds in 1841 and the first Western record of the psychoactive effects of B. caapi (in the Brazilian Amazon) was made in 1852. Several reports were published in the mid-nineteenth century about the use of B. caapi. In 1922-1923 a film of traditional yag&eacute ceremonies was shot and then shown to the annual American Pharmaceutical Association meeting. The popularization of ayahuasca in writing and media during the late twentieth century has led to many North Americans and Europeans travelling to South America to take ayahausca in "traditional" settings, creating a new industry around this "entheotourism". This industry helped cause a major shift in how ayahuasca use is viewed in its native lands. By the late 1990s, ayahuasca brews started to be sold by street vendors in glass bottles in some South American cities.

effects :: 
effectsSections :: onset	Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, effects begin between 20 and 60 minutes after ingestion.
duration	Ayahuasca users report 2-6 hours of peak effects with 1-8 hours after of lingering effects, depending on dosage and individual metabolism. Higher doses usually have longer-lasting effects.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: There are a few serious injuries and deaths associated with ayahuasca use. Because ayahuasca contains a monoamine oxidaze inhibitor, which deactivates a key enzyme responsible for breaking down chemicals that could otherwise be toxic, it is possible to have severe negative reactions to ayahuasca, particularly if it is combined with proscribed foods and/or drugs. Those who chose to consume ayahuasca should educate themselves about compounds that are contraindicated when taking MAOI drugs before attempting any use.  Combining MAOI drugs with a wide array of over-the-counter, prescription, or recreational drugs can lead to very unpleasant or fatal effects. There are many articles devoted to discussions of foods and drugs that are contraindicated with any MAOI use.  Also, as with any intense psychedelic, ayahuasca can precipitate short- or long-term changes in personality or catalyze psychotic or neurotic episodes.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Ayahuasca can have extreme, possibly fatal negative side effects if taken with some presciptions drugs, especially antidepressants such as Prozac and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Experienced ayahuasca practictioners and South American shamans recommend against taking ayahuasca while on most-or-all pharmaceuticals. In many traditions, there are required periods of abstinence and special dietary restrictions observed prior to ayahuasca ingestion and for a few days after each ingestion.
addiction	Ayahuasca is not believed to be physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependence. Withdrawal effects following discontinuation have not been reported.

REGULATED	No

CLASSIFICATION	Hallucinogen
federalLawText :: The most common plant constituents of Ayahuasca (Banisteriopsis caapi & Psychotria viridis) are not specifically scheduled in the United States. Neither is the ayahuasca brew specifically named as a scheduled substance. However, P. Viridis contains DMT which is DEA schedule 1. The DEA has recently been making the argument that a plant or brew is illegal if it contains DMT or any other controlled substance.	
Major court decisions in the United States in 2006 and 2009 have left the religious use of ayahuasca more or less legal for the protected groups, the UDV and Santo Daime (see UDV Wins Supreme Court Case and Santo Daime Wins Court Decision). It is likely that the Drug Enforcement Administration will continue to fight to get those rulings overridden. As of March 18, 2009, it is still presumptively illegal in the United States to use ayahuasca unless one is a member of the two churches that have successfully sued the U.S. government.

internationalLaw :: Brazil	In Brazil, a protracted legal battle in the 1980's ended with the Brazilian government finding ayahuasca churches use of ayahuasca was was safe and showed no signs of harming the members. In 1992, Brazil formally legalized the constituent plants and ayahuasca tea.(see the Brazilian Ayahuasca legal notes)
Canada	Harmaline is Schedule III in Canada. Since ayahuasca brews almost always contain a harmaline-containing plant, it is possible that ayahuasca could be considered illegal on these grounds.
France	As of May 3, 2005, France added Banisteriopsis caapi, Peganum harmala, Psychotria viridis, Diplopterys cabrerana, Mimosa hostilis, Banisteriopsis rusbyana, harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine (THH), haroml, and harmalol to the list of controlled substances. See France Control Ayahuasca Plants and Chemicals. Earlier, in Jan 2005, a Paris court of appeals determined that Ayahuasca is not considered a preparation of DMT and is therefore not a controlled substance.

Spain	According to the Spanish Scientist Josep Maria Fericgla, in 2012, Ayahuasca is not controlled under Spanish law. See http://josepmfericgla.org/2012/informe-pericial-sobre-el-estatus-legal-de-la-ayahuasca. This is not an official government statement of policy, just one person's analysis of the complex issues of having a natural extract that contains a controlled substance. In April 2000: Santo Daime Church members arrested, Daime (ayahuasca tea) seized. Six Spanish and two Brazilian members were arrested. The members were eventually released in May of 2000.
