[Basics]
description :: There are many compounds which fit into the category of 'piperazines'. Benzylpiperazine (BZP), the one most commonly used as a recreational substance, is a CNS stimulant which people describe as a noticeably different stimulant effect than amphetamines. It is not particularly popular because many people find that it has more side effects than amphetamines. [ Main Piperazines Vault ]

CLASSIFICATION	Stimulant
federalLawText :: Piperazine is a class of chemicals which includes some psychoactive and non psychoactive members. The most commonly used recreational psychoactive piperazines in the late 1990s and early 2000s were BZP and TFMPP.	
On July 18th, 2002, the DEA announced its intent to schedule BZP & TFMPP. On September 20, after two months, they issued their final order to place BZP & TFMPP in Schedule I by emergency order. On March 18, 2004, BZP was permanently placed into Schedule I and TFMPP was removed from Schedule I.	
We are unaware of other piperazines which have been specifically controlled.
stateLaw :: null
internationalLaw :: Australia	BZP and TFMPP are controlled in most Australian states. After extensive looking, it appears that BZP and TFMPP are scheduled in the highest drug restriction schedule in Vic, NSW, SA, NT and Qld. No information yet about Tasmania and ACT as their acts are just too different from the other states. (thanks UL and TW of http://shaman-australis.com.au/, Aug 2006)
Canada	We have been told that BZP, TFMPP and other recreational piperazines are currently uncontrolled in Canada under the CDSA and Food and Drug Act and aren't labeled under Health Canada's list of items under a stop order. (unconfirmed) (thanks A)
Israel	In December 2008, BZP, TFMPP, and pFPP were added to Israel's list of controlled substances, making them illegal to buy, sell, or possess. (thanks A)
Japan	4Mpp, MBZP, MDBP, and are controlled as "Designated Substances" (Shitei-Yakubutsu) by the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, making them illegal to possess or sell (see Ref)
