legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Erythroxylon coca
REGULATED	Yes
STATUS	Scheduled
SCHEDULE	Schedule II
CLASSIFICATION	Stimulant
federalLawText :: Coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves are both Schedule II in the United States. This means they are illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription.	
Despite the clear Federal and state law, coca leaves are widely available for commercial retail outlets in 2013 and have been for over a decade.
stateLaw :: Illinois	Illinois State Appellate Court for the Circuit Court of Cook County found that drinking coca tea without knowledge that it contains cocaine cannot be grounds for being fired as a police officer under "zero-tolerance drug testing" policies. See Garrido v Cook County Sheriff's Merit Board, June 9 2004.
internationalLaw :: Bolivia	Coca leaf is legal in Bolivia in its unrefined form. In recent years, under the presidency of Evo Morales (an indigenous south-American and former coca farmer) Bolivia has softened its stance towards coca. During Morales's presidency, he has vocally supported the traditional and ceremonial use of the coca plant. While coca's official legal status in Bolivia remains unchanged, the traditional uses of the coca leaf, by indigenous people, has become more widely accepted among officials. No real change has occurred regarding refined cocaine or its commercial production. (Thanks globalloon) (last updated Sep 20 2010)
