Propylhexedrine is legal to buy, possess, and ingest without a license or prescription. Sales for human consumption are regulated by the FDA and each formulation or product requires specific FDA approval.	
It appears that Propylhexedrine was placed in Schedule V in the United States in May 4, 1988 (53 FR 10869) and then removed from Schedule V on Dec 3, 1991 (56 FR 61372). Unfortunately, we do not have access to the federal register entry to determine why it was unscheduled. [DEA Ref]
