[Basics]
description :: Sildenafil, better known as Viagra, is prescribed to men reporting impotence, for use approx. one hour before sexual activity, to produce erection. Viagra is not currently approved for use by women, though research is being conducted. There are numerous reports of off-label use for sexual enhancement of Viagra by men and women not experiencing Erectile Dysfunction.  There is some evidence, presented at the Society for Neuroscience Conference in Oct 2006, that sildenafil has an an anti-anxiety effect in rats as measured by standard tests (Vogel confict, etc) and this may play some part in why it is a successful ED treatment drug in humans.

Also use cautiously if you have a genital problem or deformity such as Peyronie's disease.  If an erection lasts more than 4 hours, seek treatment immediately.
