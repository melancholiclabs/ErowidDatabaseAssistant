[Basics]
description :: 2C-T-7 is a psychedelic phenethylamine developed by Alexander Shulgin around 1980. The effects of 2C-T-7 share some general similarities with LSD & 2CB, with its length of action more like that of LSD. While most of the chemicals in its class are not known to cause acute physical dangers, 2C-T-7's safety profile for wide use is not well known nor researched. As with all new chemicals, it is difficult to be certain what the variety of reactions to the substance will be and the reports of use so far have a lot of conflicting and confusing elements, including duration, physical stimulation, dosage, etc. [ Main 2C-T-7 Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	A standard oral dose of 2C-T-7 is between 10 - 50 mg. It is generally found in powder form although it is also produced and sold in pill format, most recently at 7 mg per tablet. Insufflated doses are considerably lower. Users should be extremely careful with dosages as 2C-T-7 can cause unexpected delirium and dissociation at high doses.
price	Rare, but sometimes sold at parties for 5-20$ per dose, available from exotic chemical suppliers for 375-450$ per gram, about the same from underground suppliers. (August 2000)
law	2C-T-7 is was placed in Schedule I by emergency order of the DEA on September 20, 2002. This makes it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in the United States without a DEA license. Although Sweden controls 2C-T-7, we are not aware of any other countries that specifically list it as illegal to possess or sell.
chemistry	2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-propylthiophenethylamine (2C-T-7) is a synthetic chemical in the phenethylamine class. It is related structurally to 2C-B and Mescaline.
pharmacology	Pharmacology Summary Needed.
production	Production Summary Needed.
history	2C-T-7's chemistry was first published in Alexander Shulgin's book PiHKAL in 1991. It was produced underground in college labs and by small commercial research labs until the late 1990's when it began being produced and sold commercially around the world.
terminology	The Substance:2C-T-7; T7; Beautiful. The Experience:Tripping.
effects :: 2C-T-7's effects are unique but classically psychedelic, with some general similarities to LSD & 2C-B. 2C-T-7's effects can include psychedelic visuals (patterning, light sensitivity, color enhancement, etc), mood lift, empathogenesis, anxiety or calmness, emotional volatility, increased sociability, associative / psychedelic ideation, etc. Some users have report unexpected and disconcerting dissociation at high doses. Relatively prominent visuals are common with 2C-T-7 and at higher doses the visuals can overwhelm the visual field creating a 'psychedelic soup'.
effectsSections :: onset	Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, 2C-T-7 generally takes 1-2.5 hours to take effect. On a full stomach, onset can be considerably slower than normal.
duration	2C-T-7's primary effects can last as long as 10-12 hours, with after effects for another 4-6 hours.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: The most common problems reported by 2C-T-7 users appear to be nausea, vomiting, unpleasant dissociation,  and overwhelming visuals at high doses. As with most psychedelics, there is also the possibility of anxiety or panic attacks. In a few higher dose cases, severe dissociation has been reported where the user experienced loss of memory, mental confusion, and extreme inability to deal with real-world situations while fully physically functional. Some reports include the user becoming unusually enraged and violent. This can lead to potentially dangerous situations if an individual is left unsupervised. Heavy dissociation and vomiting can be a life-threatening combination. At least 3 deaths have been reported (April 2001).
problemsSections :: contraindications	Do not take 2C-T-7 if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorix or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). 2C-T-7 and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. If you have a seizure or convulsive disorder or heart problems, you may be at higher risk for health problems when taking 2C-T-7. Diabetics should monitor their blood sugar closely as there have been some reports of problems. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 2C-T-7 as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
addiction	2C-T-7 is neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependance. Withdrawal effects following discontinuation have not been reported. As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after 2C-T-7 use. Using 2C-T-7 two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.
long	Long Term Health Problems Summary Needed.
death	There have been 3 deaths which have been tied directly to 2C-T-7. The exact mechanism of death is not yet known, but it is beginning to appear that some direct pharmacological effect may be responsible (rather than an indirect effect such as aspirating vomit). There have been no formal evaluations of the Toxicity of 2C-T-7 that we're aware of.

description :: 2C-T-7 Overdoses & Delirium #	A handful of reports of 2C-T-7 overdoses (non life threatening) have come through in the last 4 months and it is extremely important to realize that 2C-T-7 is a powerful psychedelic with a dose-response profile that makes it very easy to take way too much. Some users have recently reported either taking themselves to the hospital or being taken to the emergency room from 2C-T-7 alone. Users who have taken as little as 10 mg orally have reported being overwhelmed with anxiety and discomfort, while some users who have snorted 15 mg or taken 30 mg or more orally report being completely overwhelmed by the intensity of the experience. These users report becoming frightened for their health, completely dissociated (forgetting who they are, where they are, that they've ingested a chemical), experiencing intense and frightening body pains (stomach & muscle cramps), becoming unable to see because of the intensity of the visuals, becoming beligerent, etc. This is especially worrisome with 2C-T-7 because the effects last so long and high dose users often wander around and get themselves in trouble in public by being completely	incapable of taking care of themselves.	
Many users of 2C-T-7 are most familiar with the effects of ecstasy and it's important to realize that 2C-T-7 is very unlike ecstasy and can often lead to difficult, intense, and overwhelmingly confusing experiences which are much safer and more useful when taken in a safe, private context with a sitter or therapist. This is not ecstasy. Be extremely careful with this chemical, measure it very carefully, and do not eyeball doses.	


Notes on Snorting 2C-T-7 (Not Recommended) #	There's been quite a bit of discussion about snorting 2C-T-7 partially because of the reported deaths in combination with some of the dramatic and severe overdose reactions people have had. In Erowid's Fall 2000 2C-T-7 survey, conducted by Murple, one surprising result was that people reported that they snorted 2C-T-7 in order to reduce side effects, but actually ended up experiencing greater side effects, on average, than people who ingested it orally (see	Murple's writeup).	
Using the pure powdered 2C-T-7 causes most users intense discomfort and is very likely to be bad for the sinuses. As with other snortables, this will lead to more serious problems if used chronicly. Unlike Cocaine or Ketamine, 2C-T-7 causes intense burning pain which lasts 5-15 minutes before it begins to fade, leaves an unpleasant drip that permeates the experience, and can lead to sinus and throat infections in some people. This is similar to the experiences reported when other 2C- compounds are snorted. Most users contacted by Erowid said they would not repeat snorting 2C-T-7 because of the increased side effects and accidental overdoses.

doseText :: 2C-T-7 is a phenethylamine somewhat similar in effects to 2C-B. It is generally available as powder, though it has in the past been available in tablet form. Some people appear to be significantly more sensitive to 2C-T-7 than others. Be careful with starting doses if you don't know your sensitivity. It is generally taken orally.  There are some reports of 2C-T-7 taking an unusually long time to come on, even when insufflated. Most reports, however, indicate that effects begin within a few minutes and ramp up to the peak for up to an hour or so.  Please read the 2C-T-7 Overdose Warning. Dosages this small must be measured very very carefully.  Warning: There have been several reports of deaths from 2C-T-7, and many reports of severe dissociation and vomiting (a dangerous combination) after both oral and insufflated use.

Because dosage between users varies so wildly, it is dangerous for first time users to snort more than a few milligrams because people have had dissociated, overwhelming experiences on as little as 6 mg insufflated. It is imperative that dosed be measured using a milligram scale for accuracy.   Read the effects page about snorting 2C-T-7.
