[Basics]
description :: Olanzapine is a thienobenzodiazapine atypical antipsychotic. It is chemically related to Quetiapine (Seroquel) and Clozapine (Clozaril). Olanzapine is used for reducing psychotic symptoms for medium-length periods (1-8 weeks). Long term usage has not been well studied and because it can take more than a day to reach stable blood levels, it is not often chosen for acute, emergency treatment. [ Main Olanzapine Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	Taken orally, 5-20mg per day, starting at 5mg/day and then increased slowly by increments of 5mg per day, giving a week between changes to allow levels to stabilize. Zyprexa brand olanzapine comes in 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 15mg, and 20mg tablets. The Zyprexa Zydis tablets are an orally disintigrating version for people who have a tendency to spit out their medication.

effects :: The peak plasma concetrations of olanzapine are achieved 6 hours after ingestion. The initial effects of olanzapine are sedation and, possibly, a dry mouth. The antipsychotic effect of olanzapine is not immediately apparent after single dosing. This is likely due to the fact that olanzapine accumulates over the period of a week to a steady state level in the bloodstream. These levels are roughly twice what would occur after a single dose of olanzapine.   Experimentally, olanzapine causes sedation in a a higher percentage of people than quetiapine or clozapine, however it is generally considered less sedating than either of these drugs. This makes olanzapine a very attractive choice for many patients who are bound to antipsychotics.  There is reason to believe that the 5-HT2 antagonism of olanzapine may have an antidepressant effect.
effectsSections :: onset	PROBLEMS As with other antipsychotics, olanzapine is considered quite safe. Nonetheless, there is a small potential for a syndrome known as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). NMS *has* been reported with olanzapine. Tardive Dyskinesia (potentially irreversible, involuntary, jerking) may develop in patients treated with olanzapine for long periods.   SideEffects Mental side effects include agitation, akathisia, amnesia, anxiety, dizziness, euphoria, headache, hostility, insomnia, sleepiness, stuttering, akithisia (restlessness of the legs).  Physical side effects include chest pain, edema, hypotension, tachycardia, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, increased appetite, PMS (in women), weight gain, joint pain, rash, fever, and occasional sexual side effects.  Interactions  Carbamazepine reduces the effectiveness of olanzapine. Levodopa's effects may be blocked by the systemic antagonism of olanzapine.

description :: Pharmacology / Mechanism of Action	The mechanism of olanzapine is unknown, however it is hypothesized that its actions are mediated through a combination of serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) and Dopamine type 2 (DA-2) antagonism. Antagonism at other receptors may explain the side effects observed with olanzapine. Antagonism at histamine type 1 may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Antagonism at muscarinic 1-5 receptors may explain the anticholinergic effects of olanzapine. Antagonism at alpha type 1 adregenic receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension associated with olanzapine. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminic H1 and alpha1-adrenergic receptors also possible.
