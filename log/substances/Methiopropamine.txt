description :: Methiopropamine is a stimulant chemically related to methamphetamine. Though it was first synthesized in 1942, it wasn't until it began being sold online in late 2010 that it saw much recreational use. It has a very short history of human use and little is known about potential health risks or benefits.

negativeEffects :: Risk of psychological dependency	Vasoconstriction, cold extremities	Anxiety	Difficulty urinating	Labored breathing, pain with deep breaths.	Racing heart (somewhat common with higher doses and/or redosing)	Chest tightness, pains (somewhat common with higher doses and/or redosing)	Significant hangover after extended use (nausea, headache, dizziness, lack of energy)	Bad smelling sweat, burps, and gas (only reported by a few users)
description :: General Effects Notes	The effects of methiopropamine are usually compared to methamphetamine, but there are too few experience reports with reliably sourced material to say much else with confidence. Described by some as a fairly clean stimulant effect at lower dosages. Negative side effects and difficult come-down period are significantly worse with higher doses and/or redosing multiple times.	
Addiction and Compulsive Use	It is not yet known how addictive or likely methiopropamine is to cause long-term compulsive use. Many reports describe it as "more-ish", indicating it induces compulsive re-dosing in some users, but not as badly as MDPV or mephedrone. Because its use is so new and uncommon, no definitive statements about it can be made.

Good bits of speed without the stupidly long duration and resulting insomnia." -- by Rickolasnice, Bluelight.ru thread 544266, Jan 18, 2011[60 mg insufflated] "[...] insufflated said dose at around 2pm, felt really nice for a good 2.5 hours - had to fight off the urge to redose (which was very strong, akin to mephedrone)" -- by Midinoz, Bluelight.ru thread 544266, Jan 5, 2011[200 mg insufflated over 8 hrs] "[...] after it started to wear off we were all violently sick.

[Law]
legalTable :: U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY
Methiopropamine
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
SCHEDULE	Unscheduled
federalLawText :: Methiopropamine is unscheduled in the United States. It is possible that it could be considered an analog (of methamphetamine), but it does not contain a benzene ring and the 5-member ring contains sulfur, rendering it questionable whether it qualifies as "substantially similar to the chemical structure" of methamphetamine. All Federal Analogues are determined in court and threat of prosecution is a real possibility if a drug is sold for recreational use. We are unaware of any cases against individuals for possession alone.	
In one article published by the DEA in 2011, the authors claim that "Although it is claimed to be legal, it is a 2-thienyl analog of the Schedule II controlled substance, methamphetamine, and may be controlled within the United States." See Methiopropamine: An Analytical Profile, by Casale JF, Hayes PA (2011)
stateLaw :: Arizona	Added to the "Dangerous drug" list in April, 2014.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
