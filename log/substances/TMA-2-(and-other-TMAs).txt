[Basics]
description :: TMA-2, or 2,4,5-TrimethoxyAmphetamine, is a synthetic chemical that is related to, but more potent than mescaline. It has both stimulant and psychedelic effects. It's qualitative effects on mood alteration and sensory enhancement are similar to mescaline. [ Main TMA-2 Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	10-50 mg. Dr. Shulgin suggests that there is only a small margin between the dose needed to produce psychoactive effects and a toxic dose (Shulgin, 1976). Toxic dose in humans is not known.
price	Price Summary Needed.
law	TMA is a schedule I substance in the United States, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess. TMA-2 - TMA-6 are all positional isomers of TMA, making them schedule I substances as well. TMA-2 has been placed in Schedule I by the U.N. Narcotics Commission.
chemistry	2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA-2) is a synthetic chemical which can be derived from the Calamus root's active ingredient Asarone.
pharmacology	TMA-2 is known to be a 5-HT2 agonist.
production	Production Summary Needed.
history	TMA-2 was first synthesized in 1933 and it's psychoactive properties were recognized by A. Shulgin in 1962.

effects :: Effects Summary Needed.
effectsSections :: onset	Onset Summary Needed.
duration	Duration Summary Needed.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: Although TMA-2 has some stimulant effects, one researcher found high doses of TMA-2 caused bradycardia (slow heart) and hypothermia (low temperature) in rats (Mallaret 2003, Ho 1970). There are too few reports to sanity-check whether these findings hold true for humans.  Because of its psychedelic properties, mental health risks are assumed to be similar to those of other hallucinogens and psychedelic-crisis management is appropriate for acute handling of anxiety and panic reactions. More severe schizophrenic or psychotic reactions would be handled as with other hallucinogen precipitated mental crises.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Do not take TMA-2 if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). 2C-B and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. If you have a seizure or convulsive disorder or heart problems, you may be at higher risk for health problems when taking TMA-2. Diabetics should monitor their blood sugar closely as there have been some reports of problems. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as TMA-2 as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
addiction	direct data about this exists, but the addiction potential of TMA-2 is considered to be extremely low due to its psychedelic effects. Summary Needed.
long	Long Term Health Problems Summary Needed.
death	Risk of Death Summary Needed.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
