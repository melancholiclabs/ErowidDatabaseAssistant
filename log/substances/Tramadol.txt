Tramadol is widely available with prescription in pharmacies. Tramadol is manufactured in Iran under a range of different brand names by up to 10 Iranian pharmaceutical companies, and is also imported from one or two foreign companies, mainly from Germany, the UK, and India.

Japan	A visitor described that Tramadol is likely to be reclassified as controlled in Japan in 2012, though as of May 2012, it is legal to import up to a 60 day supply for personal use as long as one has a simplified license to import: "I have recently imported tramadol for the treatment of Migraines to Japan and it got stopped at customs. I was forced to apply for a license in order to continue to delivery. In previous years I was able to receive the delivery normally. It's only now that it has been put up for review that it has become difficult. The license is easy enough to acquire , it consists of a few questions about your health and an agreement that the medicine is for personal use only. Also, if you import under 2 months worth of medicine. In the case of Tramadol this is 19,200mg (in other words 50mg caps x 384) in total then you can avoid the additional paperwork and signatures of qualified medical personnel." (unconfirmed) (thanks r) (last updated May 12, 2012)

United Arab Emirates (UAE)	One visitor reminds us that countries like the UAE have EXTREMELY harsh penalties for violating their drug laws, especially around opioids. Googling UAE and opium or poppy will find news stories documenting years of prison for trivial amounts of accidentally "imported" opioids by visitors. They write : "Tramadolt is prescription only and regulated by the government. This means that only specialists in medicine (surgeons) can prescribe a 4 week supply (only 4 weeks at a time) and the government reviews each and every prescription (as in, count every capsule) as well as the patient and doctor prescribing it. Non-surgeons such as internists, can only prescribe for 2 weeks (nurses cannot) and at A&E, only 2 days can be given when discharged. Tramadol is regulated highly and is the strongest opiate available (morphine and codeine are banned and treated as illegal). Having tramadol without prescription or giving it to someone can result in 4 years in prison. Quite likely the same for importing for personal use but I didn't dare to buy some from overseas. Also, acquiring tramadol via a doctor is very difficult, you must have a serious pain condition to get even 200mgs/day prescribed. Not worth the effort and there are a lot of horror stories surrounding this country and expats bringing in controlled drugs."

Previously, tramadol was a prescription only medicine (see The Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997). (thanks jh) (last updated May 22 2014)
