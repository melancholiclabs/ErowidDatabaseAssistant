[Basics]
description :: 2C-I is a phenethylamine somewhat similar in effects to 2C-B. It became available on the grey markets in 2002, but distribution dropped off after a series of DEA busts in 2004 and the prosecutions of vendors selling research chemicals for recreational use. It is available primarily in powder form--though some pressed tablets have been seen--and is generally taken orally. [ Main 2C-I Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	A standard oral dose of 2C-I is between 10-25 mg. Recent reports suggest that 2C-I is just slightly more potent than 2C-B (slightly less material needed for the same level of effects).
price	2C-I is sold at $300-500 USD per gram retail, and $50-200 USD per gram wholesale (2011).
law	2C-I is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States meaning that possession is not specifically illegal. It became controlled under federal law in the US in 2012. 2C-I is scheduled in Germany and Denmark, but not in the European Union (EU).
chemistry	2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Iodophenethylamine (2C-I) is a synthetic chemical phenethylamine related structurally to 2C-B.
pharmacology	Pharmacology Summary Needed.
production	The bulk of available 2C-I is primarily produced by experienced chemists in commercial labs.
history	2C-I first gained public awareness after the publication of PiHKAL by Alexander & Ann Shulgin.
terminology	The Substance:2C-I. The Experience:Tripping.
effects :: 
effectsSections :: onset	Depending on how much and how recently the user has eaten, oral 2C-I takes between 45-75 minutes to take effect. On a full stomach, onset can be considerably slower.
duration	The primary effects of 2C-I last approximately 5-8 hours when taken orally.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: Problems Summary Needed.
problemsSections :: contraindications	Do not take 2C-I if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorix or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). 2C-I and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 2C-I as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
addiction	2C-I is neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependance. Withdrawal effects following discontinuation have not been reported. As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after 2C-I use. Using 2C-I two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.
long	Long Term Health Problems Summary Needed.
death	Risk of Death Summary Needed.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
