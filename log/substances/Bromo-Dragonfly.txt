internationalLaw :: Australia	Bromo-Dragonfly was added to Schedule 9, Australia's most restrictive schedule, in February 2009. See http://www.tga.gov.au/ndpsc/gazette/g0902pos.pdf. (Thanks B) (last updated Apr 11, 2009)
Denmark	Effective December 5, 2007, the Danish Sundhedsstyrelsen (Health Board) has banned non-research use of Bromo-Dragonfly, citing serious psychological and health risks. Minister of Health and Prohibition Jakob Axel Nielsen commented "The ban agrees with the government's commitment to react quickly and sharply against new eurphoric drugs. It is vital that we send a clear and unambiguous message that we neither can nor want to accept substances such as Bromo-Dragonfly." (see Pressemeddelelse). (translation thanks to S, PFC)
Finland	Finland has added Bromo-Dragonfly to its list of controlled substances, but we don't know what specific 'schedule' or classification it is in. See (in Finnish) http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1288452412062.html. (thanks a) (last updated Oct 3 2012)

doseText :: Bromo-Dragonfly is a chemical which has very little history of human use and was used as a novel brain research chemical with rats in the mid 1990s at Purdue. When it was discovered to be active in rats, it was found to be very potent. A few years after the initial papers describing its activity in the brain, reports surfaced of human experimentation, suggesting oral activity well under 1 milligram. Some disputed these findings and said that Bromo-Dragonfly was only active under 1 mg when injected.  In May 2005, a quantity of this chemical became available in some human experimental psychoactive markets. Erowid received a smattering of reports about its use and an increasing number of questions about it. As of Jan 2009, we have still only received approximately 50 first-hand accounts of ingestion of Bromo-Dragonfly. The findings are very contradictory, with some people claiming strong oral activity at 300 micrograms (ug), while others say they got virtually no effects at 1.5 mg (1500 ug).  There may be two distinct "batches" of material: one more potent and one less. Since 2006, most reports indicate that the dosage range for available material is 800-2000 ug rather than the more potent batch of product sold as BromoDragonfly in 2005. In 2005, the more potent batch was sometimes called the "European" batch and the less potent batch the "American" batch, although this distinction is not in common use. It seems likely that these two batches were not even the same chemical, but it is impossible to know.   Bromo-Dragonfly has been found in some pressed tablets, but more commonly it is found on blotter or in powder form.   There have been a growing number of reports from people saying that they got blotter that they thought was LSD, but instead it felt like something else. Generally, since there is no verification of the substance, these reports are not considered when trying to estimate dosage and effects of novel chemicals.  Please note that with only a small number of reports available, it is unwise to assume that these reports are representative of how a chemical presumed to be Bromo-Dragonfly will affect other individuals. Please see the Research Chemical Vault for more information about chemicals for research that are sold for human consumption.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
