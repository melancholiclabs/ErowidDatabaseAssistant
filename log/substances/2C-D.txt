description :: General Effects Notes	The effects of 2C-D are usually compared to 2C-B or other psychedelic stimulants and sometimes to MDMA (ecstasy). Its effects are generally considered milder than 2C-B, LSD, or MDMA. 2C-D is not known for strong visuals nor is it generally considered as empathic or euphoric as MDMA (ecstasy). Alexander Shulgin referred to it as "pharmacological tofu", pointing out that it has been used to extend the effects of other compounds and that it is bland by itself. There has been some experimentation with the use of low-dose 2C-D as a "smart drug".	
Routes of Administration	2C-D is most often taken orally, though there are reports of it being insufflated. When insufflated, nasal and sinus irritation are common.	
Addiction and Compulsive Use	2C-D is not known to be associated with compulsive use and physical dependence is extremely unlikely. Because its use is so uncommon, no definitive statements about its use can be made.
experienceReports :: [45-50 mg] "Crazy amphetamine-like shakes and chills. Worse than I was expecting. [...] I cannot get comfortable, no matter what position or how high the heater is turned up. [...] I am in a mildly-happy, mildly-euphoric 'fun' space. I notice details around me that I usually don't. Flowers and colors look exquisite. Unlike my current and past favorites (mescaline and methylone), there is no sexual push at all. In fact, sex seems quite irrelavent and difficult to even think about. The biggest positive going for this material, however, is that it allowed my mind to explore dichotomies in everything I thought about." -- Exp 32497[15 mg + alcohol] "Very slow ride up... very pleasant all around. A companion and I both likened it to MDMA. It made me very sociable. It also squelched all the drowsiness that came from all the alcohol I drank (which was impressive considering the quantity of alcohol I had). [...] Attention span was fucking shot. [...] No enhancements of bright lights or any visuals at all. I didn't get a chance to check my pupils. My behaviour was very spontaneous and weird. Ideas just came to me, bizarre things I wouldn't normally say." -- Exp 33231[10 mg + cannabis] "Finished my shower without any strongly noticeable changes from the compound, but I was starting to feel something a 'clear-head' sensation where my thoughts came without effort, but I was still groggy as well, considering the early hour and lack of sleep. [...] So it was then that I sat down to pack some Herb into my pipe and read the first part of Nietsche's 'The Antichrist' for my philosophy class. Usually it is very difficult for me to read anything that early in the morning with any level of appreciable comprehension, but today I was able to clearly focus on the text and make my way through the first 25 paragraphs without much break in concentration or thought." -- Exp 70588[20 mg] "Butterflies in stomach whole time. OK. This is about the right level. In retrospect, not too interesting. Primarily a stimulant, not entirely physically pleasant. The visual is not too exciting. I am easily distracted. One line of thought to another. I feel that more would be too stimulating." -- Exp 83181[40 mg] "As I engaged in conversation I noticed the reported 'smart drug' effects. Indeed, my memory, concentration, and thought processes were far from impaired. In fact I felt kind of like I had taken a nootropic like piracetam because I was feeling rather sharp. But, as I looked down at the carpet and saw the first signs of movement, and the body high increased, it did become more difficult to communicate. Yet I remained social, laughing at people's jokes and occasionally chiming in. My sense of humor was most definitely heightened." -- Exp 46855[15 mg] "Slight visual distortions were apparent. I would frequently notice shimmering disturbances in my peripheral vision, but as soon as I focused on them, they would disappear. It definitely seemed like I was on the verge of breaking into mild hallucinations. At one point I tried watching a television set that was present in the room, and the images on the TV kept alternating between being sped up or slowed down. [...] A moderate degree of pleasurable body sensations was present as well. I found my self often laughing or giggling inappropriately, and just felt all in all stupid. I also seemed to have a high degree of 'mental restlessness'; thoughts in my head were jumping around from topic to topic." -- Exp 33689[21.5 mg] "Effects are light but persistent and present. I find myself easily enmeshed in aesthetics. I spend the next couple hours playing with photographing items and examining seeds and flowers with a magnifying glass. I chat with my partner and on irc and my mood is light, fun, and friendly. [...] Overall, very pleasant, about 3 hours of mild intoxication, enhanced aesthetic appreciation. Some skin sensual sensations that could be fun to explore sexually, but not a strong erotic push at all. Very little visual disturbance. Distinct mood lift. Definitely something I would repeat." -- Exp 13361
