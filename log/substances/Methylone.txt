description :: Methylone is a psychedelic phenethylamine, with effects similar to, but not identical, to those of MDMA. Doses for methylone are typically higher than those for MDMA.	
According to Winta, describing adding bump-doses onto the initial amount of methylone: "This is usually 50-100 mg's for my friends and myself. We do this 'trick' almost every time, the thing is that the booster hits right about the same level as the first trip but doesn't take quite as long.	
Lets say we redose with 50 mg when the first effect starts to wear off, we get our trip boosted back to the same level for around another hour. I If we take 100 mg booster, it lasts about 2 hours instead. A whole full dose as a boost will take about the same time again as if I had started over."	
Another report describes an idiosyncratic reaction: "As for bumping, after the first hour, oral bumps of 50 mg worked so-so and 100 mg definitely extending things by an hour, but after three 100 mg bumps, an hour apart each, the sedating effect took completely over, and resulted in a very pleasant state that was almost exactly like the feeling after smoking opium, enjoyed that for another 2-3 hours (lost track of time) until falling into a very deep and restful sleep."	
A few methylone users have reported chest pains and heart palpitations during and after use, especially with repeated or high doses.

doseText :: Methylone (bk-MDMA, Explosion, Ease, m1) dosages are not well documented in the literature and the following dosages are based on a submission by Winta and reports gathered by Erowid. Methylone is generally available as pure crystals and rarely, if ever, pressed into tablets. As one contributor notes, "The most reasonable dosage recommendation for such a poorly documented substance would be 'none at all', but since this advice is unlikely to be taken seriously." The variability in response reported is reason for special concern and should be taken seriously by those considering ingesting methylone.  Dosages vary considerably between individuals, with some methylone users reporting that they "never" exceed 100 mg, while others report "barely reaching" threshold at 200 mg.     Oral Methylone Dosages Threshold60 - 120 mg Light100 - 150 mg Common100 - 250 mg Strong160 - 270 mg Heavy250 + mg    Onset : 15 - 60 minutes Duration : 2 - 3.5 hours Normal After Effects : 6 - 24 hours      Some respondents say that increasing dose with methylone beyond 100-180 mg causes increased physical effects and does not substantially improve the empathic cognitive effects.  Insufflated dosages appear to be slightly lower than oral dosages.  Stimulation / Sedation Some have reported worrying heart rate and blood pressure increases at doses over 180-200 mg.  While some people report stimulation, there are also reports of seemingly paradoxical sedation effects.  We have one report of a male who found it took over 250 mg of material to approach the bottom of a 'common' dose and found 300 mg to be "just right" and the same material affected others at more common doses.    Boosting / Bumping Methylone is sometimes used with a larger "attack" dose (first dose) and then smaller "bumps" to maintain the effects for a longer period. These bumps are taken orally or insufflated and are often around 30 - 100 mg oral and 20-80 mg insufflated.  A third-to-half-dose re-dose usually extends the duration for another hour, a full-dose redose  often extends the duration for another 1-2 hours. Some say that taking a booster dose  more than 2 hours after the initial dose will not result in extending the desired effects.    Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. Know your Body - Know your Mind - Know your Substance - Know your Source.   Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources and should not be construed as recommendations. Individuals can respond differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.

summaryText :: Chemicals marked on Erowid by our Research Chemical Symbol should be considered experimental chemicals.	Although some people are willing to ingest these chemicals for their effects, it is not reasonable	to assume that these chemicals are in any way 'safe' to use recreationally. Although	all psychoactive use involves risk, many substances in this class of chemicals have undergone virtually no human or animal toxicity studies. Research chemicals are those for which there is little to no data on possible long term problems, addiction potential, allergic reactions, or acute overdoses.	
Publication of information by Erowid about human use of these chemicals is not intended to	endorse their non-laboratory use. It is important to remember that reactions to psychoactives vary	dramatically from person to person. Extrapolating anything from any single person's experience with a chemical is inappropriate and may result in dangerous and possibly fatal adverse reactions.	
Some reports of use may include extremely glowing "wow"-type experiences. Reports of this nature	should not be misunderstood to suggest that they are common or typical of those who ingest the	substance, or that the effects will be pleasant or desirable.	
Additionally, the reliability of many sources of these products can be questionable. Mislabeling,	misidentification, issues of purity, adulteration, and misrepresentation (substitution) are unfortunately a	common problem with research chemicals.	
Consider carefully before choosing to use these substances.
