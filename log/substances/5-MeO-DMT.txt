description :: 5-MeO-DMT is a naturally occurring psychedelic present in numerous plants and in the venom of the Bufo alvarius toad. It is found in some traditional S. American shamanic snuffs and sometimes in ayahuasca brews. It is somewhat comparable in effects to DMT; however it is substantially more potent, so it should not be confused with DMT.

[Basics]
description :: 5-MeO-DMT is a psychoactive tryptamine which was first identified in the mid 20th Century as a chemical in a South American plant entheogen. It is a common constituent of many different plants and has been used traditionally in psychoactives snuffs such as Yopo from the Anadenanthera colubrina seeds, Epena from Virola sap, and some ayahuasca-type brews where 5-MeO-DMT containing plants are used as admixtures. In the other parts of the world, including the U.S., 5-MeO-DMT is mostly encountered as a crystalline chemical and smoked, snorted, or swallowed for recreation and/or insight. 5-MeO-DMT is sometimes confused with its more well-known cousin N,N-DMT (usually just called "DMT") which can lead to disasterous results because of the large difference in appropriate dosages (5-MeO-DMT's dosage is perhaps 1/10 to 1/2 that of N,N-DMT, depending on individual reaction).  5-MeO-DMT has been called just "5MEO", but as other "5-MeO" (methoxy group on the 5 position, such as 5-MeO-DiPT) psychoactives have become known this shortened name is slowly losing its usefulness. 5-MeO-DMT's effects are much less visual than N,N-DMT's, with many users reporting no visual distortions at all. The experience itself is sometimes characterized as 'the void'. [ Main 5-MeO-DMT Vault ]
descriptionSections :: dose	The standard dosage range for smoked 5-MeO-DMT is between 2-15 mg; for insufflation the dose range is 5-20 mg. These are very small amounts of material and should be measured extremely carefully. Many people achieve full world-shattering effects at as low as 3-5 mg (8-12 insufflated) and it is not uncommon for individuals who smoke 20-30 mg to have psychological and mental difficulties lasting several weeks.
price	Occasionally sold at parties for 1-20 USD per dose. Available from exotic chemical suppliers for 150-250 USD per gram, somewhat higher from underground sources.
law	5-MeO-DMT is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, making it illegal to possess without a license as of Jan 19 2011. Sales or possession could be prosecuted under the Analog Act, although only one case of prosecution has been brought to our attention. 5-MeO-DMT is now controlled / illegal in a number of countries including Denmark, Germany, Greece, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and Romania.
chemistry	5-Methoxy-N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a naturally occurring chemical in the tryptamine class. It is related structurally to N,N-DMT, Bufotenine, Psilocybin, and Psilocin.
pharmacology	Pharmacology Summary Needed.
production	Production Summary Needed.
history	In the early 1950s, 5-MeO-DMT was identified as one of the main psychoactive ingredients in 'cohoba' snuffs used in the northern Amazon basin. Its use in the form of snuffs and brews has been documented as early as the 8th Century A.D. from a burial site in Northern Chile which found snuffing paraphernalia and traces of N,N-DMT, 5-MeO-DMT and Bufotenine. Other archeological sites have also uncovered seeds of 5-MeO-DMT containing Anadenanthera species from around the same time period. Its use as a recreational psychoactive has increased through the 80's and 90's.
terminology	The Substance:5-MeO-DMT; 5-MeO. The Experience:Tripping; The Void.
effects :: The smoked 5-MeO-DMT experience is short, but generally incredibly intense. Onset is fast and furious, sometimes compared to being launched from a cannon. It is a fully engaging and enveloping experience of visions (actual visual effects less common) which varies greatly from one individual to the next. Users report profound changes in ontological perspective, experiencing the void, the shattering of the universe, frightening and overwhelming forces, complete shifts in perception and identity followed by an abrupt return to baseline. Because of the nature and intensity of the experience, users are almost always seated or lying down with someone nearby to take the pipe as the experience begins. Unlike with N,N-DMT, few users report significant coherent visual effects.  The insufflated 5-MeO-DMT experience has a slower/gentler onset, with effects building over 20-45 minutes, and aftereffects lasting for 1-3 hours. Users report being better able to integrate the intensity and insights achieved from this method, with more clarity of thought, and time to explore those thoughts. As with the smoked method, dose response is extremely variable, and a heavy dose can be equally difficult, with aftereffects lasting hours or days.
effectsSections :: onset	When smoked, 5-MeO-DMT generally reaches full effects within 10-60 seconds of inhalation. Insufflated, effects come in generally within 5 minutes.
duration	The primary effects of 5-MeO-DMT last approximately 5-20 minutes when smoked, 30-45 minutes when insufflated. For many people there is an additional period of time (1-2 hrs) before fully returning to baseline. Some people find the 5-MeO-DMT experience difficult to integrate and experience unsettling thoughts and feelings for days after use.
visuals	Visuals Summary Needed.
problems :: One of the primary physical problems encountered with smoked 5-MeO-DMT is the harsh nature of the smoke which can cause throat and lung irritation. Integration of the experience can also cause difficulties for some individuals, especially at higher doses. Difficult integration periods can lead to anxiety, difficulty focusing on daily tasks, preoccupation with the experience, difficulty sleeping, etc. Generally these effects dissipate on their own over the course of a few days but there are reports of persisting problems.
problemsSections :: contraindications	The effects of smoked 5-MeO-DMT are dramatically increased if used by individuals currently taking MAOIs. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not stand up. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 5-MeO-DMT as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
addiction	5-MeO-DMT is neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependance. As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after 5-MeO-DMT use. Using 5-MeO-DMT a second time within a few hours is likely to lead to a significantly diminished experience the second time.
long	Long Term Health Problems Summary Needed.
death	Risk of Death Summary Needed.

[Health]
notes :: 5-MeO-DMT is a chemical not associated with major physical health issues unless combined with MAOIs. The primary health risks associated with the use of 5-MeO-DMT are mental health problems, like lasting Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)-type reactions where people feel shocked for days, weeks, months, or years after their last use.
deaths :: null
warnings :: Lung / Breathing Issues   When smoked, there is the risk of causing discomfort or pain from inhaling the chemical vapor. This could be a result of pH or heat. We have one report, which was also published in The Entheogen Review, of a woman who experienced severe lung pain smoking 5-MeO-DMT. Although risk of this is generally low because the dosage smoked is usually less than 20 mg, smokers of 5-MeO-DMT are cautioned to be aware of this issue.
Short Term Unconsciousness / Non-Responsiveness   Short term (1-10 minute) non-responsiveness or unconsciousness is frequent with smoked doses over 8-10 mg or insufflated doses over 15-20 mg. Sitters are extremely important. If 5-MeO-DMT smokers move around during the peak, they can be clumsy, fall, or knock things over and hurt themselves. The peak passes quickly and most users prefer to remain sitting or lying down for the 3-10 minutes of intensity.
Contraindication : 5-MeO-DMT and MAOIs   Although 5-MeO-DMT is present in some plants used in ayahuasca and in some ayahuasca brews, Erowid has received several reports of very troubling physical reactions in people who have ingested 5-MeO-DMT with MAOI harmala alkaloids. There appears to be the risk of severe hypertensive symptoms, overheating, serotonin syndrome, etc. It is important to note that the profile of these risks are not fully understood, because the long history of use of brews containing some amount the two in combination.  A case of a 17-year-old male was reported to us in December 2002. He ingested an extract of Syrian Rue and then smoked an unknown (but large) dose of powdered, chemical 5-MeO-DMT. He quickly became non-responsive and fell to the ground, began convulsing (myoclonic jerking), and his sitter called an ambulance for help. He was found to have had a pulse of 180, blood pressure 200/125,  and temperature 106.0 F. These levels are dangerously high. He was minimally responsive but became wildly agitated upon stimulation (even just speaking to him). He was treated with diazepam and transferred by helicopter to a Boston area hospital. The patient may have suffered lasting damage to his kidneys and rhabdomyolysis. A formal case report of this incident was published in a 2004 issue of the Journal of Toxicology & Clinical Toxicology titled "Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Poisoning Resulting from Internet Misinformation on Illicit Substances".  In December 2004, we received an unconfirmed report of a death related to the ingestion of 200 mg of 5-MeO-DMT with some amount of "yage". This death was later described in the case report "A Fatal Intoxication Following the Ingestion of 5-Methoxy-N,N-Dimethyltryptamine in an Ayahuasca Preparation" in the November/December 2005 issue of the Journal of Analytical Toxicology, and the follow-up commentary "A Demand for Clarity Regarding a Case Report on the Ingestion of 5-Methoxy-N,N-Dimethyltryptamine in an Ayahuasca Preparation" was published in the July/August 2006 issue.  We have also received some reports from groups experimenting with making pharmahuasca using 5-MeO-DMT who have said that they had much higher incidence of bad reactions with 5-MeO-DMT than with N,N-DMT. They discontinued using the 5-MeO-DMT.
Lasting Anxiety and Sleep Disruption   Erowid has receied several reports from those who have smoked 5-MeO-DMT who experienced intense panic attacks, lasting chronic anxiety, and sleep disruption/insomnia triggered by a single session of smoking 5-MeO-DMT. It is unknown how common this reaction is.
