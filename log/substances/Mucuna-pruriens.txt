Mucuna pruriens
REGULATED	No
STATUS	Ambiguous
SCHEDULE	ContainsSchedule I Chemical
CLASSIFICATION	Hallucinogen
federalLawText :: Mucuna pruriens is not specifically a controlled species in the United States. Live plants and seeds are bought and sold and are not generally considered illegal. However, DMT, one of the chemicals contained in the plant, is Schedule I in the U.S. Practically, this means that if an extraction is done on DMT containing Mucuna species, the resulting DMT is illegal to possess.	
Large scale (especially commercial) extraction of DMT from Mucuna species falls into the realm of "clearly illegal" and would very likely be prosecuted. It is also possible that importation of DMT containing Mucuna species into the United States could result in problems with customs, especially if large volumes are imported.
